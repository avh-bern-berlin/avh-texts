A small number of the least elevated of<lb break="yes"/>these volcanoes throw out running lava.

The height of these colossal mountains, that<lb break="yes"/>surpasses five times that of Vesuvius, and their inland situa-<lb break="no"/>tion, are, without doubt, the principal causes of these ano-<lb break="no"/>malies.

                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The mountains of the kingdom of Quito occasionally offer<lb break="yes"/>another spectacle, less alarming, but not less curious to the<lb break="yes" />naturalist. The great explosions are periodical, and some-<lb break="no"/>what rare. Cotopaxi, Tungurahua, and Sangay, some-<lb break="no"/>times do not present one in twenty or thirty years. But<lb break="yes"/>during such intervals even these volcanoes will discharge<lb break="yes"/>enormous quantities of argillaceous mud; and, what is more<lb break="yes"/>extraordinary, an innumerable quantity of fish. By acci-<lb break="no"/>dent, none of these volcanic inundations took place the year<lb break="yes"/>that I passed the Andes of Quito; but the fish vomited from<lb break="yes"/>the volcanoes is a ph&#x00E6;nomenon so common, and so gene-<lb break="no"/>rally known by all the inhabitants of that country, that there<lb break="yes"/>cannot remain the least doubt of its authenticity. As there<lb break="yes"/>are in these regions several very well informed persons, who<lb break="yes"/>have successfully devoted themselves to the physical sciences,<lb break="yes"/>I have had an opportunity of procuring exact information (<hi rendition="#i">ren-<lb break="no" />seignemens</hi>) respecting these fishes. M. de Larrea, at Quito,<lb break="yes"/>well versed in the study of chemistry, who has formed a<lb break="yes"/>cabinet of the minerals of his country, has been, above all<lb break="yes"/>others, the most useful to me in these researches. Exa-<lb break="no"/>mining the archives of several little towns in the neighbour-<lb break="no"/>hood of Cotopaxi, in order to extract the epochs of the great<lb break="yes"/>earthquakes, that fortunately have been preserved with care,<lb break="yes"/>I there found some notes on the fish ejected from the vol-<lb break="no"/>
                    <fw type="catch" place="bottom">canoes.</fw>
                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="335" facs="#f0003"/> canoes. On the estates of the marquis of Selvalegre the<lb break="yes"/>Cotopaxi had thrown a quantity so great, that their putre-<lb break="no"/>faction spread a fetid odour around. In 1691 the almost<lb break="yes"/>extinguished volcano of Imbaburu threw out thousands on<lb break="yes"/>the fields in the environs of the city of Ibarra. The putrid<lb break="yes"/>fevers which commenced at that period were attributed to<lb break="yes"/>the miasma which exhaled from these fish, heaped on the sur-<lb break="no"/>face of the earth and exposed to the rays of the sun. The<lb break="yes"/>last time that Imbaburu ejected fish was on the 19th of June<lb break="yes"/>1698, when the volcano of Cargneirazo sunk, and thousands<lb break="yes"/>of these animals enveloped in argillaceous mud were thrown<lb break="yes"/>over the crumbling borders.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The Cotopaxi and Tungurahua throw out fish, sometimes<lb break="yes"/>by the crater which is at the top of these mountains, sometimes<lb break="yes"/>by lateral vents, but constantly at 2500 or 2600 toises above<lb break="yes"/>the level of the sea: the adjacent plains being 1300 toises<lb break="yes"/>high, one may conclude that these animals issue from a<lb break="yes"/>point which is 1300 toises more elevated than the plains on<lb break="yes"/>which they are thrown. Some Indians have assured me<lb break="yes"/>that the fish vomited by the volcanoes were sometimes still<lb break="yes"/>living in descending along the flank of the mountain: but<lb break="yes"/>this fact does not appear to me sufficiently proved: certain it<lb break="yes"/>is, that among the thousands of dead fish that in a few hours<lb break="yes"/>are seen descending from Cotopaxi with great bodies of cold<lb break="yes"/>fresh water, there are very few that are so much disfigured<lb break="yes"/>that one can believe them to have been exposed to the action<lb break="yes"/>of a strong heat. This fact becomes still more striking when<lb break="yes"/>we consider the soft flesh of these animals, and the thick<lb break="yes"/>smoke which the volcano exhales during the eruption. It ap-<lb break="no"/>peared to me of very great importance to descriptive natural<lb break="yes"/>history to verify sufficiently the nature of these animals.<lb break="yes"/>All the inhabitants agree that they are identical with those<lb break="yes"/>which are found in the rivulets at the foot of these volcanoes,<lb break="yes"/>and called <hi rendition="#i">prennadillas</hi>

I have designed it,<lb break="yes"/>with care, on the spot, and my design has been coloured by<lb break="yes"/>M. <persName key="turpin_pjf">Turpin</persName>. I have observed that the <hi rendition="#i">prennadilla</hi> is a new<lb break="yes"/>species of the genus <hi rendition="#i">silurus.</hi> M. <persName key="lacepede_bg">Lacepede</persName>, who has also<lb break="yes" />examined it, advised me to place it in that division of <hi rendition="#i" >silurus</hi>
                    <lb break="yes"/>which, in the fifth volume of his Natural History of Fishes,<lb break="yes"/>he has described under the name of <hi rendition="#i" >pimelodes.</hi>
                </p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>This new species of <hi rendition="#i">pimelodus</hi> has a depressed body of an<lb break="yes"/>olive colour mixed with little black spots. The mouth, which<lb break="yes"/>is at the extremity of the nose, is very large, and furnished<lb break="yes"/>with two barbillons or whiskers attached to the jaws. The<lb break="yes"/>nostrils are tubulous; the eyes are very small, and placed<lb break="yes"/>towards the middle of the head. The skin of the body and<lb break="yes"/>the tail is covered with an abundant mucus, and the mouth<lb break="yes"/>is furnished with very small teeth. The branchial membrane<lb break="yes"/>has four radii, like the <hi rendition="#i" >pimelodus chilensis;</hi> the pectoral fin<lb break="yes"/>has nine; the ventral five; the first dorsal six; the fin of the<lb break="yes"/>anus seven; and that of the tail, which is bifid, has twelve<lb break="yes"/>radii. The first radius of all the fins is indented on the out-<lb break="no"/>side: the second dorsal fin is adipose, and placed near the<lb break="yes"/>tail. This little <hi rendition="#i">pimelodus,</hi> which is found in lakes even to<lb break="yes"/>the height of 1700 toises, is, without doubt, the fish that<lb break="yes"/>lives in the most elevated regions of our globe. Its common<lb break="yes"/>length scarcely amounts to ten centimetres (four inches);<lb break="yes"/>but there are varieties which do not appear to reach five cen-<lb break="no"/>timetres (two inches) in length.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>In the system of ichthyology this new species of <hi rendition="#i" >pimelodus</hi>
                    <lb break="yes"/>should be ranged in the first sub-genus established by <persName key="lacepede_bg">Lace-<lb break="no"/>pede</persName>, among the forked-tailed pimelodes. It must be in the<lb break="yes"/>first species, before the <hi rendition="#i">pimelodus bagre.</hi> As it is the only<lb break="yes" />one of that division that has but two whiskers, I give it the<lb break="yes" />name of<lb break="yes"/>

                <p>This little fish lives in rivulets at the temperature of 10°<lb break="yes"/>of the centigrade thermometer, while other species of the<lb break="yes"/>same genus exist in rivers in the plains the water of which is<lb break="yes"/>at 27°.

                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>From the enormous quantity of <hi rendition="#i">pimelodes</hi> that the vol-<lb break="no"/>canoes of the kingdom of Quito occasionally discharge, one<lb break="yes"/>cannot doubt that country contains great subterranean<lb break="yes"/>lakes which conceal these fishes; for the individuals that<lb break="yes"/>exist in the little rivers around are very few in number.<lb break="yes"/>A part of those rivers may communicate with the subterra-<lb break="no"/>nean pits: it is also probable that the first <hi rendition="#i" >pimelodes</hi> which<lb break="yes"/>have inhabited these pits have mounted there against the<lb break="yes"/>current. I have seen fish in the caverns of Derbyshire, in<lb break="yes"/>England; and near Gailenreuth, in Germany, where the<lb break="yes"/>fossil heads of bears and lions are found, there are living<lb break="yes"/>trouts in the grottoes, which at present are very distant from<lb break="yes"/>any rivulet, and greatly elevated above the level of the neigh-<lb break="no"/>bouring waters. In the province of Quito, the subterraneous<lb break="yes"/>roarings that accompany the earthquakes; the masses of<lb break="yes"/>rocks that we think we hear crumbling down below the<lb break="yes"/>earth we walk on; the immense quantity of water that<lb break="yes"/>issues from the earth in the driest places during the volcanic<lb break="yes"/>explosions; and numerous other ph&#x00E6;nomena, indicate that<lb break="yes"/>all the soil of this elevated plain is undermined. But, if it is<lb break="yes"/>easy to conceive that vast subterranean basins may be filled<lb break="yes"/>with water which nourishes fishes, it is more difficult to ex-<lb break="no"/>plain how these animals are attracted by volcanoes that<lb break="yes"/>ascend to the height of 1300 toises, and discharged either<lb break="yes"/>by their craters or by their lateral vents. Should we sup-<lb break="no"/>pose that the <hi rendition="#i">pimelodes</hi> exist in subterranean basins of the<lb break="yes"/>same height at which they are seen to issue? How conceive<lb break="yes"/>their origin in a position so extraordinary; in the flank of a<lb break="yes"/>cone so often heated, and perhaps partly produced by vol-<lb break="no"/>canic fire? Whatever may be the source from which they<lb break="yes"/>issue, the perfect state in which they are found induces us<lb break="yes"/>to believe that those volcanoes, the most elevated and the<lb break="yes"/>most active in the world, experience, from time to time, con-<lb break="no"/>vulsive movements, during which the disengagement of ca-<lb break="no"/>loric appears less considerable than we should suppose it.<lb break="yes"/>Earthquakes do not always accompany those ph&#x00E6;nomena.<lb break="yes"/>Perhaps, in the different concamerations that may be ad-<lb break="no"/>
