    <div n="1"><head><hi rendition="#k">Extraordinary Subterranean Noises.</hi></head><lb/><p>&#x2014;The most striking instance of unin-<lb/>terrupted subterranean noise, unaccompa-<lb/>nied
                    by any trace of earthquake, is the<lb/>phenomenon which is known in the
                    Mexi-<lb/>can territory by the name of &#x201C;the subter-<lb/>ranean roaring
                    and thundering (<hi rendition="#i">bramidos y<lb/>truenos subterraneos</hi>) of
                    Guanaxuato.&#x201D;<lb/>This rich and celebrated mountain-city is<lb/>situated
                    at a distance from any active vol-<lb/>cano. The noise began on the 9th
                    January,<lb/>1784, at midnight, and lasted above a<lb/>month. Humboldt gives a
                    circumstantial<lb/>description of the phenomenon from the<lb/>report of many
                    witnesses, and from the<lb/>documents of the municipality which he<lb/>was
                    permitted to make use of. &#x201C;From the<lb/>13th to the 16th of <choice>
                        <sic>Jauuary</sic>
                        <corr type="editorial">January</corr>
                    </choice> it was as if<lb/>there were heavy storm clouds under the<lb/>feet of
                    the inhabitants, in which slow<lb/>rolling thunder alternated with
                    short<lb/>thunder-claps. The noise ceased gradually,<lb/>as it had commenced; it
                    was confined to a<lb/>small space, for it was not heard in a<lb/>basaltic
                    district at the distance of only a<lb/>few miles. Almost all the
                    inhabitants<lb/>were terrified and quitted the city, in<lb/>which large masses
                    of silver were stored;<lb/>but the most courageous, when they had<lb/>become
                    somewhat accustomed to the sub-<lb/>terranean thunder, returned and
                    fought<lb/>with the bands of robbers who had taken<lb/>possession of the
                    treasure. Neither at the<lb/>surface, nor in the mines 1598 English feet<lb/>in
                    depth, could the slightest trembling of<lb/>the ground be perceived. In no part
                    of<lb/>the whole mountainous country of Mexico<lb/>had anything similar been
                    ever known<lb/>before; nor has this awful phenomenon<lb/>been since repeated.
                    Thus, as chasms in<lb/>the interior of the earth close or open, the<lb/><cb/>
                    propagation of the waves of sound is either<lb/>arrested in its progress or
                    continued until<lb/>it reaches the ear.&#x201D;</p><lb/></div><lb/></body><back></back>
