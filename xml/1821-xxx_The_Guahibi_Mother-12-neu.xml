                    before we<lb break="yes"/>reached its confluence, a granitic hummock, that rises
                        on<lb break="yes"/>the western bank, near the mouth of the Guasacavi, is

                        la Madre.</hi> We inquired the cause of so<lb break="yes"/>singular a
                    denomination. Father Zea could not satisfy<lb break="yes"/>our curiosity; but
                    some weeks after, another missionary,<lb break="yes"/>one of the predecessors of
                    this ecclesiastic, whom we found<lb break="yes"/>settled at San Fernando, as
                    president of the missions, re-<lb break="no"/>lated to us an event which I
                    recorded in my journal, and<lb break="yes"/>which excited in our minds the most
                    painful feelings. If,<lb break="yes"/>in these solitary scenes, man scarcely
                    leaves behind him<lb break="yes"/>any trace of his existence, it is doubly
                    humiliating for a<lb break="yes"/>European to see perpetuated by the name of a
                    rock, by one<lb break="yes"/>of those imperishable monuments of nature, the
                        remem-<lb break="no"/>brance of the moral degradation of our species, and
                    the con-<lb break="no"/>trast between the virtues of a savage, and the barbarism
                        of<lb break="yes"/>civilized man.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>In 1797, the missionary of San Fernando had led his<lb break="yes"/>Indians to
                    the banks of the Rio Guaviare, on one of those<lb break="yes"/>hostile
                    incursions, which are prohibited alike by religion<lb break="yes"/>and the
                    Spanish laws. They found in an <choice><sic>Italian</sic><corr type="editorial"
                            >Indian</corr></choice> hut, a<lb break="yes"/>Guahibi mother with three
                    children, two of whom were<lb break="yes"/>still infants. They were occupied in
                    preparing the flour<lb break="yes"/>of Cassava. Resistance was impossible; the
                    father was<lb break="yes"/>gone to fish, and the mother tried in vain to flee
                    with her<lb break="yes"/>children. Scarcely had she reached the savannah,
                        when<lb break="yes"/>she was seized by the Indians of the mission, who go to
                        <hi rendition="#i">hunt<lb break="yes"/>men,</hi> like the whites and the
                    negroes in Africa. The mo-<lb break="no"/>ther and her children were bound, and
                    dragged to the<lb break="yes"/>bank of the river. The monk, seated in his boat,
                        waited<lb break="yes"/>the issue of an expedition, of which he partook not
                    the dan-<lb break="no"/>ger. Had the mother made too violent a resistance,
                        the<lb break="yes"/>Indians would have killed her; for every thing is
                        permitted<lb break="yes"/>when they go to the conquest of souls, and it is
                    children in<lb break="yes"/>particular they seek to capture, in order to treat
                    them in<lb break="yes"/>the mission as <hi rendition="#i">poitos,</hi> or slaves
                    of the Christians. The pri-<lb break="no"/>soners were carried to San Fernando,
                    in the hope that the<lb break="yes"/>mother would be unable to find her way back
                    to her home<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="77" facs="#f0003"/> by land. Far from those children who had
                        accompanied<lb break="yes"/>their father on the day in which she had been
                    carried off,<lb break="yes"/>this unhappy woman showed signs of the deepest
                        despair.<lb break="yes"/>She attempted to take back to her family the
                    children who<lb break="yes"/>had been snatched away by the missionary, and fled
                        with<lb break="yes"/>them repeatedly from the village of San Fernando, but
                        the<lb break="yes"/>Indians never failed to seize her anew: and the
                        missionary,<lb break="yes"/>after having caused her to be mercilessly
                    beaten, took the<lb break="yes"/>cruel resolution of separating the mother from
                    the two chil-<lb break="no"/>dren who had been carried off with her. She was
                        convey-<lb break="no"/>ed alone toward the missions of the Negro, going up
                        the<lb break="yes"/>Atabapo. Slightly bound, she was seated at the bow of<lb
                        break="yes"/>the boat, ignorant of the fate that awaited her; but she<lb
                        break="yes"/>judged, by the direction of the sun, that she was removed<lb
                        break="yes"/>farther and farther from her hut and her native country.<lb
                        break="yes"/>She succeeded in breaking her bonds, threw herself into the<lb
                        break="yes"/>water, and swam to the left bank of the Atabapo. The<lb
                        break="yes"/>current carried her to a shelf of rock, which bears her name<lb
                        break="yes"/>to this day. She landed, and took shelter in the woods,<lb
                        break="yes"/>but the president of the missions ordered the Indians to row<lb
                        break="yes"/>to the shore, and follow the traces of the Guahibi. In the<lb
                        break="yes"/>evening, she was brought back. Stretched upon the rock<lb
                        break="yes"/>(<hi rendition="#i">la Piedra de la Madre</hi>), a cruel
                    punishment was inflicted<lb break="yes"/>on her with those straps of manatee
                    leather, which serve for<lb break="yes"/>whips in that country, and with which
                    the Alcades are al-<lb break="no"/>ways furnished. This unhappy woman, her hands
                        tied<lb break="yes"/>behind her back with strong stalks of <hi
                        rendition="#i">mavacure,</hi> was then<lb break="yes"/>dragged to the
                    mission of Javita.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>She was there thrown into one of the caravanseras that<lb break="yes"/>are called
                        <hi rendition="#i">Casa del Rey.</hi> It was the rainy season, and the<lb
                        break="yes"/>night was profoundly dark. Forests, till then believed to<lb
                        break="yes"/>be impenetrable, separated the mission of Javita from that<lb
                        break="yes"/>of San Fernando, which was twenty-five leagues distant in<lb
                        break="yes"/>a straight line. No other part is known than that of the<lb
                        break="yes"/>rivers; no man ever attempted to go by land from one<lb
                        break="yes"/>village to another, were they only a few leagues apart. But<lb
                        break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="78" facs="#f0004"/> such difficulties do not stop a mother who is
                    separated from<lb break="yes"/>her children. Her children are at San Fernando de
                        Ata-<lb break="no"/>bapo; she must find them again, she must execute her
                        pro-<lb break="no"/>ject of delivering them from the hands of Christians,
                        of<lb break="yes"/>bringing them back to their father on the banks of the<lb
                        break="yes"/>Guaviare. The Guahibi was carelessly guarded in the<lb
                        break="yes"/>caravansera. Her arms being wounded, the Indians of<lb
                        break="yes"/>Javita had loosened her bonds, unknown to the missionary<lb
                        break="yes"/>and the alcades. She succeeded by the help of her teeth<lb
                        break="yes"/>in breaking them entirely; disappeared during the night;<lb
                        break="yes"/>and, at the fourth rising sun, was seen at the mission of<lb
                        break="yes"/>San Fernando, hovering around the hut where her children<lb
                        break="yes"/>were confined. &#x201C;What that woman performed,&#x201D;
                        added<lb break="yes"/>the missionary who gave us this sad narrative,
                    &#x201C;the most<lb break="yes"/>robust Indian would not have ventured to
                    undertake. She<lb break="yes"/>traversed the woods at a season when the sky is
                        constantly<lb break="yes"/>covered with clouds, and the sun during whole
                    days ap-<lb break="no"/>pears but for a few minutes. Did the course of the
                        waters<lb break="yes"/>direct her way<choice><sic>, the</sic><corr

                        her<lb break="yes"/>to go far from the banks of the main stream, through
                        the<lb break="yes"/>midst of woods, where the movement of the waters is
                        almost<lb break="yes"/>imperceptible. How often must she have been stopped
                    by the<lb break="yes"/>thorny lianas that form a net-work around the trunks
                        they<lb break="yes"/>entwine! How often must she have swam across the
                        rivu-<lb break="no"/>lets that run into the Atabapo! This unfortunate
                        woman<lb break="yes"/>was asked how she had sustained herself during the

                    Guahibi had peacefully enjoyed the<lb break="yes"/>happiness of remaining with
                    her children, and if any re-<lb break="no"/>pentance had followed this excess of
                    cruelty. He would<lb break="yes"/>not satisfy our curiosity; but at our return
                    from the Rio<lb break="yes"/>Negro we learnt, that the Indian mother was not
