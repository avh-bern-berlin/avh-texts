    <div n="1"><head><hi rendition="#k">Death of M. de Buch.</hi></head><p>&#x2014;Baron Humboldt,<lb/>in a letter to Sir R. Murchison, has said: &#x201C;Berlin, March<lb/>4, 1853.&#x2014;That I should be destined&#x2014;I, an old man<lb/>of eighty-three&#x2014;to announce to you, dear Sir Roderick,<lb/>the saddest news that I could have to convey&#x2014;to you for<lb/>whom M. De Buch professed a friendship so tender, and<lb/>to the many admirers of his genius, his vast labours,<lb/>and his noble character! Leopold De Buch was taken<lb/>from us this morning by typhoid fever,&#x2014;so violent in<lb/>its attack that two days only of danger warned us.<lb/>He was at my house so lately as the 26th [ult.] despite<lb/>the snow and the distance between us, talking geology<lb/>with the most lively interest. That evening he went<lb/>into society; and on Sunday and Monday (the 27th<lb/>and 28th) he complained of a feverish attack, which<lb/>he believed to be caused by a large chilblain swelling<lb/>from which he had suffered for years. The inflama-<lb/>tion required the application of leeches, but the pain<lb/>and the fever increased. He was speechless for thirty-<lb break="maybe"/>eight hours. ... He died surrounded by his friends,<lb/>most of whom knew nothing of his danger till Wed-<lb/>nesday evening, the 2nd of March. He and I were<lb/>united by a friendship of sixty-three years&#x2014;a friendship<lb/>which never knew interruption.&#x201D;</p></div><lb/></body><back></back>
