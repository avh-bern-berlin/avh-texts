                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The <hi rendition="#i">Deutsche Vierteljahrschrift,</hi> a new Stuttgard periodical,<lb break="yes"/>contains a dissertation which, like all the writings of Alexander<lb break="yes"/>de Humboldt, is replete with deep research and general and<lb break="yes"/>exalted views. The history of gold, the most precious of<lb break="yes"/>metals, was worthy of the pen of the illustrious author of the<lb break="yes"/>&#x201C;Voyage to the Equinoxial Regions.&#x201D;</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>In ancient times gold was sought for in Asia: it was next<lb break="yes"/>drawn from the New World, the persuasion still prevailing<lb break="yes"/>as among the ancients that this metal existed only in the<lb break="yes"/>warmest climates. In compliance with this notion the cele-<lb break="no"/>brated geographer (Toscanelli) wrote to Columbus that he<lb break="yes"/>should find no gold as long as he should meet with negroes-<lb break="no"/>@ecent discoveries have, however, confuted the opinion pre-<lb break="no"/>dominating in antiquity and the middle-ages. Gold mines<lb break="yes"/>and quarries are now wrought in Siberia, and there is no<lb break="yes"/>longer any adhering to the old doctrine, which held that heat<lb break="yes"/>was necessary for preparing gold in the bosom of the earth.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>It would be interesting to compare the production of gold,<lb break="yes"/>such as it was in former times, with that now existing, but<lb break="yes"/>@thentic data are wanting for such inquiry. The ancients<lb break="yes"/>speak of enormous masses of gold left by conquering Kings,<lb break="yes"/>@d of treasures equally immense found by conquerors in the<lb break="yes"/>@untries subjected to their arms. According to Appi@nns,<lb break="yes"/>@o writes upon documents, the treasure of Ptolemy-Phila-<lb break="no"/>delph amounted to 740,000 talents. It remains to be known<lb break="yes"/>@hat talents history means, whether they were Egyptian<lb break="yes"/>@lents or little talents of P@olemy. Even in the last case, the<lb break="yes"/>@asure would be splendid enough, for it would exceed<lb break="yes"/>40,000,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> However fabulous the @tion appears, B&#x0153;ckh,<lb break="yes"/>the author of the learned work upon the political economy of<lb break="yes"/>the Athenians, dares not dispute it, seeing the rapacity of the<lb break="yes"/>ancient despots of Asia, who scrupled not to employ the<lb break="yes"/>most odious and violent means in order to obtain posses-<lb break="no"/>sion of the gold in circulation. If the great talents<lb break="yes"/>be admitted in the statement of Appianus, Ptolemy-<lb break="no"/>Philadelph&#x2019;s treasure would be equivalent to all the<lb break="yes"/>gold now circulating in France and in Belgium; and<lb break="yes"/>@ little talents be reckoned, it would still be the<lb break="yes"/>@ass of specie circulating in Great Britain. According<lb break="yes"/>to Strabo, Alexander the Great had eighteen myriads col-<lb break="no"/>lected at Ecbatana, &#x201C;Whereupon,&#x201D; says M. de Humboldt. &#x201C;it<lb break="yes"/>must not be forgotten that in those times the precious metals<lb break="yes"/>were concentrated upon some points of the globe, and in the<lb break="yes"/>treasuries of conquerors; whereas, now-a-days, they are more<lb break="yes"/>uniformly spread over large extents of countries, and among<lb break="yes"/>large populations.&#x201D;</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>But whence came, in ancient times, those quantities of gold<lb break="yes"/>which flowed into the hands of rapacious despots? That it<lb break="yes"/>@me from the interior of Asia, from the Upper Oxus, Bac-<lb break="no"/>@iana, and the Oriental parts of the empire of the Persians is<lb break="yes"/>@rtain; but when the source of this Pactolus is sought for,<lb break="yes"/>@bulous accounts are all that assist the inquirer. The an-<lb break="no"/>cients mention ants that found gold among the mountainous<lb break="yes"/>people of the De@ds, and of griffons that guarded<lb break="yes"/>the treasures among the Arimasps. It would seem to<lb break="yes"/>@ the <hi rendition="#i">plateau</hi> of Cashgar and Acsoa, between the<lb break="yes"/>p@rallel chains of the Himalaya and Kuenlon moun-<lb break="no"/>@ins, that fable considered the source of gold. In Thibet,<lb break="yes"/>indeed, all the rivers yield gold. The Greeks consi-<lb break="no"/>d@ed as gold countries Lydia, or the banks of the streams is-<lb break="no"/>@ing from the Imolus, Phrygia, and Colchid. Those coun-<lb break="no"/>@s may have had gold sands; those sands may have been<lb break="yes"/>exhausted, as have been those of the streams of Cuba and St.<lb break="yes"/>D@mingo. M. de Humboldt observes that in general the gold<lb break="yes"/>mixed with sand is more easily removed than that which must<lb break="yes"/>be extracted from mines; such is the reason for which of forty<lb break="yes"/>places where, according to Strabo, gold sands were to be<lb break="yes"/>found, scarcely a few can now be recognised; the others have<lb break="yes"/>been exhausted.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>In Greece itself precious metals originally existed. La@rio<lb break="yes"/>was renowned for its silver mines. Gold was found in Th@s-<lb break="no"/>@a near the borders of Macedonia and Thrace, as well as in<lb break="yes"/>@ island of Thases, situated facing Thessalia. Iberia also<lb break="yes"/>furnished gold to the Phenicians and Carthagenians. There<lb break="yes"/>were years when 20,000lbs. weight were drawn from Gallicia,<lb break="yes"/>L@itania, and, above all, the Astumas. This, M. de Hum-<lb break="no"/>boldt observes, is almost as much as the Brazils have sup-<lb break="no"/>plied at their most flourishing period. As for silver, it<lb break="yes"/>abounded in Bahia and the neighbourhood of New Carthage<lb break="yes"/>(C@rthagena). There is no doubting (continues the author)<lb break="yes"/>that the earth formerly contained near its surface layers of<lb break="yes"/>gold sand or strata filled with wrecks of gold ore.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Nevertheless the production of gold in Europe was greatly<lb break="yes" />inferior to what it was in Asia; it was towards that quarter<lb break="yes" />that the eyes of conquerors were turned; it was to reach the<lb break="yes" />immense treasures supposed to exist in Lipanga that Columbus<lb break="yes" />sought a shorter way by the Atlantic Ocean. Having landed<lb break="yes"/>in the island of Haiti, he believed himself at Tarsis, Ophic,<lb break="yes" />Lipanga, and on seeing some particles of gold fancied he had<lb break="yes" />go@ possession of the richest mines of the Old World. It was<lb break="yes" />others who supplied so much gold that, as early as the year<lb break="yes" />1497, the Spanish Government was obliged to alter the rela-<lb break="no" />tive prices of the two precious metals.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>This ratio between the prices of gold and silver again under-<lb break="no"/>went a change when, towards the middle of the sixteenth cen-<lb break="no"/>tury, the rich silver mines of Potosi and Zacatecas, in Peru,<lb break="yes"/>and in northern Mexico, were discovered. &#x201C;According to<lb break="yes" />researches carefully made by me.&#x201D; says M. de Humboldt,<lb break="yes" />&#x201C;the importation of American gold was to that of silver from<lb break="yes"/>the same country, as regards weight, in the ratio of 1 to 65,<lb break="yes"/>until the opening of the gold washing in Brazils, at the be-<lb break="no"/>ginning of the eighteenth century. At present, if we con-<lb break="no"/>@ the general trade in metals carried on by Europe with<lb break="yes"/>@ parts of the world, the ratio between the two metals is no<lb break="yes"/>longer but as 1 to 47. In the first century after the discovery<lb break="yes"/>of the new Continent the relative value of the two metals<lb break="yes"/>among commercial nations fluctuated between 1:10 7-10th@<lb break="yes"/>and 1:12; in the two last centuries between 1:14 and 1:16.&#x201D;<lb break="yes"/>This ratio, adds the author, does not depend only on the<lb break="yes"/>quantity of those metals annually extracted from the bosom of<lb break="yes"/>@e earth; it is also determined by the expense of work-<lb break="no"/>ing the mines, by the demand and wants of the<lb break="yes"/>public, by the unequal deterioration; and, lastly, by<lb break="yes"/>@he more or less expensive employment of either metal<lb break="yes"/>in jewellery and other articles. As a very consider-<lb break="no"/>@ mass of the two metals already circulates, and as<lb break="yes"/>@ are by degrees put into circulation, they easily and<lb break="yes"/>@ptly spread in commerce, there can be no more large<lb break="yes"/>@ permanent fluctuations in the ratio between those values.<lb break="yes"/>@ of this occurred after the great commercial commo-<lb break="no"/>@ caused by the American revolution, as well as after the<lb break="yes"/>coining of a considerable quantity of money of one of the two<lb break="yes"/>@als. Thus, in London, though from 1817 to 1827 gold<lb break="yes"/>money was coi@ed there to the amount of 1,294,000 mares,<lb break="yes"/>@ gold and silver rose but from 1:11,97 to<lb break="yes" />1:15.60. From that period it has scarcely fallen, for, at the<lb break="yes" />e@d of 1837, one still had in London one pound of gold against<lb break="yes" />fifteen pounds 65-100 of silver.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The mass of precious metals which, from the discovery of<lb break="yes"/>America to the period of the Mexican revolution, flowed into<lb break="yes"/>Europe amounted to 2,381,600 kilogrammes of gold, and<lb break="yes"/>122,217,300 kilogrammes of @ilver (110,362,222 kilogrammes@<lb break="yes"/>@ne silver.) This last metal, if melted into a mass, would<lb break="yes"/>form a ball of the diameter of 83 7-10ths feet. It is known<lb break="yes"/>that all the gold and silver procured for the Spaniards did<lb break="yes"/>not pass through Spain. Ferdinand the Catholic retained so<lb break="yes"/>little of it that at his death scarcely enough was found for the<lb break="yes"/>expenses of his funeral.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>According to common opinion the mines of Am@ now<lb break="yes"/>vield but little. This is an erroneous notion. In 1837 the<lb break="yes"/>mines of Mexico still furnished the value of twenty to twenty-<lb break="no"/>@wo millions of piastres. Those of Zacatecas alone yielded in<lb break="yes"/>each of the years elapsed, between 1822 and 1833, the sum of<lb break="yes"/>between four and five million of piastres. Guanaxuato, it is<lb break="yes"/>true, yields now but a half of what that province formerly<lb break="yes"/>furnished.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>In 1833, 1,144 marcs of gold and 316,021 marcs of silver<lb break="yes"/>were drawn from those mines. At the beginning of this cen-<lb break="no"/>tury the production of silver was still of 755,000 marcs. The<lb break="yes"/>production of gold has diminished in the New World much more<lb break="yes"/>@han that of silver, but this diminution is not to be traced<lb break="yes"/>further than the revolution of the Spanish colonies.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>On the other hand, new mines have been opened in the<lb break="yes"/>Oural; the following is, according to the statement commu-<lb break="no"/>@icated to M. de Humboldt by the Russian Minist@r of<lb break="yes"/>Finances, what the gold mines of Siberia have supplied, dur-<lb break="no"/>ing the seven years they have been wrought, to the Mint of<lb break="yes"/>St. Petersburgh:&#x2014;</p>

                <p>The working had been at first confined to the Oural, which<lb break="yes"/>had been found to yield gold upon an extent of near seven-<lb break="no"/>teen degrees of latitude; but, since 1834, the Altai, which the<lb break="yes" />Mongols call the Gold Mountain, has been found rich in gold<lb break="yes" />sands similar to those of the Oural; in 1836, 29@ pood@ 26<lb break="yes" />pounds were exracted from the Oural, and 104<lb break="yes"/>poods 15 pounds from the Altai, altogether 398 poods<lb break="yes"/>or 27.884 mares of gold. In the next year the Oural<lb break="yes"/>supplied 309 poods, and the Altai 130; to which @<lb break="yes"/>@e added 30 ponds of gold which were extracted from @<lb break="yes"/>ores of the A@i and the @hinsk; so that Russta, @37,<lb break="yes"/>produced 469 ponds @ 7.644 kilogrammes of gold. This is<lb break="yes"/>an eighth less only of the produce of the Mina@ Geraes, in<lb break="yes"/>Brazils, at their most flourishing period, or @om 1751 to<lb break="yes"/>1761; it is a third less than the produce of the gold mines of<lb break="yes"/>New Granada, Chili, and Mexico, a short time previous to<lb break="yes"/>the revolution of the colonies. M. de Humboldt does not<lb break="yes"/>think that the working of the Siberian mines has reached its<lb break="yes"/>maximum. The Altai is, perhaps, what Herodotus designates<lb break="yes"/>as the gold country.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>In Siberia masses of gold have been found beneath the<lb break="yes"/>green turf covering the soil; in ancient times pieces even torn<lb break="yes"/>from the mountains by the water, may have been found on<lb break="yes"/>the soil itself, and have given rise to the fabulous accoun@<lb break="yes"/>propagated on the subject. A proof that of old gold circulated<lb break="yes"/>among the barbarous tribes of Siberia is that in the old<lb break="yes"/>tombs very heavy ornaments of that metal have been found,<lb break="yes"/>so much so that the extraction of all this gold from the tombs<lb break="yes"/>lowered the value of the metal.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Another source has been opened in North America. Gold<lb break="yes"/>be@ exist in the soil of some of the United States, such as<lb break="yes"/>Virginia, the Alleghany, Carolinas, Georgia, Teness@, and<lb break="yes"/>Alhabama. From 1824 to 1836 all of them together have<lb break="yes"/>vielded a quantity valued at 4.844,500 dollars. This is little<lb break="yes"/>compared with the mines of Siberia and Mexico. However,<lb break="yes"/>the gold countries can no lenger be restricted to such a @,<lb break="yes"/>or such a climate; for, as is seen, gold is spread about the<lb break="yes"/>globe without regularity; and if, on the other hand, the old<lb break="yes"/>mines supply less, others recently discovered make up for<lb break="yes"/>their deficiency, and it is but the ancient march of commer@<lb break="yes"/>which is @</p>
