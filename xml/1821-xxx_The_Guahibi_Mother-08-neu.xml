                    <hi rendition="#k">In</hi> 1797, the missionary of San Fernando<lb break="yes"
                    />had led his Indians to the banks of the<lb break="yes"/>Rio Guaviare, on one
                    of those hostile oc-<lb break="no"/>casions, which are prohibited alike by<lb
                        break="yes"/>religion and the Spanish laws. They found,<lb break="yes"/>in
                    an <choice><sic>Italian</sic><corr type="editorial">Indian</corr></choice> hut,
                    a Guahiba mother with<lb break="yes"/>three children, two of whom were still
                        in-<lb break="no"/>fants. They were occupied in preparing<lb break="yes"
                    />the flour of Cassava. Resistance was im-<lb break="no"/>possible; the father
                    was gone to fish, the<lb break="yes"/>unhappy mother tried in vain to flee
                        with<lb break="yes"/>her children. Scarcely had she reached<lb break="yes"
                    />the Savannah, when she was seized by the<lb break="yes"/>Indians of the
                    mission, who hunt men with<lb break="yes"/>the ferocity of the whites and the
                        negroes<lb break="yes"/>in Africa. The wretched mother and her<lb
                        break="yes"/>children were bound, and dragged to the<lb break="yes"/>bank of
                    the river. The monk, seated in<lb break="yes"/>his boat, waited the issue of
                    this expedition<lb break="yes"/>of barbarity, and of which he partook not<lb
                        break="yes"/>the danger. Had the mother made too<lb break="yes"/>violent a
                    resistance, the Indians would<lb break="yes"/>unquestionably have killed her,
                    for any<lb break="yes"/>excess is permitted them when they go to<lb break="yes"
                    />the conquest of souls, as they term it, (a la<lb break="yes"/>conquista
                    espiritual), and it is children<lb break="yes"/>whom they particularly seek to
                    capture, in<lb break="yes"/>order to treat them, in the mission, as<lb
                        break="yes"/>poitos, or slaves of the Christians. The<lb break="yes"
                    />prisoners were carried to San Fernando, in<lb break="yes"/>the hope, that in
                    the event of escape, the<lb break="yes"/>mother would be unable to find her
                        way<lb break="yes"/>back to her house, by land.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Far from those children who had accom-<lb break="no"/>panied their father on the
                    day on which<lb break="yes"/>she had been carried off, this unhappy<lb
                        break="yes"/>woman shewed signs of the deepest de-<lb break="no"/>spair. She
                    attempted to take back to her<lb break="yes"/>family the children who had been
                        thus<lb break="yes"/>brutally snatched away by the missionary,<lb
                        break="yes"/>and fled with them repeatedly from the<lb break="yes"/>village
                    of San Fernando, but the Indians<lb break="yes"/>never failed to seize her anew;
                    and the<lb break="yes"/>missionary, after having caused the poor<lb break="yes"
                    />wretch to be mercilessly beaten, took the<lb break="yes"/>cruel resolution of
                    separating the mother<lb break="yes"/>from the two children, who had been
                        car-<lb break="no"/>
                    <cb/> ried off with her. She was now conveyed<lb break="yes"/>alone toward the
                    mission of the Rio Negro,<lb break="yes"/>going up the river Atabapo; slightly
                        bound,<lb break="yes"/>she was seated at the bow of the boat,<lb break="yes"
                    />utterly ignorant of the fate that awaited<lb break="yes"/>her; but she judged,
                    by the direction of<lb break="yes"/>the sun, that she was removed farther and<lb
                        break="yes"/>farther from her hut and her native coun-<lb break="no"/>try.
                    Seizing a favourable opportunity,<lb break="yes"/>she succeeded in breaking her
                    bonds, threw<lb break="yes"/>herself into the water, and swam to the<lb
                        break="yes"/>left bank of the river. The current car-<lb break="no"/>ried
                    her to a shelf of rock, which bears her<lb break="yes"/>name to this day. Here
                    she landed, and<lb break="yes"/>took shelter in the woods, but the presi-<lb
                        break="no"/>dent of the missions, astonished at her cou-<lb break="no"
                    />rage, ordered his Indians to row to the<lb break="yes"/>shore, and followed
                    the traces of the Gua-<lb break="no"/>hibi. In the evening the unhappy
                        creature<lb break="yes"/>was brought back. Stretched upon the<lb break="yes"
                    />rock, still called (la piedra de la Madre),<lb break="yes"/>a cruel punishment
                    was inflicted on her<lb break="yes"/>with those straps of manatee leather,
                        which<lb break="yes"/>serve for whips in that country, and with<lb
                        break="yes"/>which the Alcades are always furnished;<lb break="yes"/>and the
                    unhappy woman, her hands tied<lb break="yes"/>behind her back with strong stalks
                    of ma-<lb break="no"/>vacure, was then dragged to the mission<lb break="yes"/>of
                    Javita.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>She was there thrown into one of the<lb break="yes"/>caravanseras that are called
                    Casa del Rey.<lb break="yes"/>It was during the rainy season, when the<lb
                        break="yes"/>night was profoundly dark, forests, till<lb break="yes"/>then,
                    believed to be impenetrable, separated<lb break="yes"/>the mission of Javita
                    from that of San<lb break="yes"/>Fernando, the nearest distance to which<lb
                        break="yes"/>was twenty-five leagues in a straight line.<lb break="yes"/>No
                    other part of the country is known, but<lb break="yes"/>the course of the
                    rivers; nor does any man<lb break="yes"/>ever attempt to go by land from one
                        vil-<lb break="no"/>lage to another, were they only a few<lb break="yes"
                    />leagues apart. But what difficulties shall<lb break="yes"/>stay a mother, who
                    is separated from her<lb break="yes"/>children. The children of this devoted<lb
                        break="yes"/>and courageous woman are at San Fer-<lb break="no"/>nando de
                    Atabapo; nature cries out, in-<lb break="no"/>citing her to find them again; she
                        con-<lb break="no"/>
                    <pb n="219" facs="#f0002"/>
                    <cb/> ceives the possibility of executing her<lb break="yes"/>project of
                    delivering them from the hands<lb break="yes"/>of Christians, and of bringing
                    them back<lb break="yes"/>to their father on the banks of the Gua-<lb break="no"
                    />viare. The Guahibi was carelessly guard-<lb break="no"/>ed in the caravansera.
                    Her arms being<lb break="yes"/>wounded, the Indians of Javita had loosen-<lb
                        break="no"/>ed her bonds, unknown to the missionary and<lb break="yes"/>the
                    Alcades. She succeeded, by the help<lb break="yes"/>of her teeth, in breaking
                    them entirely;<lb break="yes"/>disappeared during the night; and at the<lb
                        break="yes"/>fourth rising sun had actually arrived at<lb break="yes"/>the
                    mission of San Fernando, and was seen<lb break="yes"/>hovering around the hut
                    where her children<lb break="yes"/>were confined. &#x201C;What that wonderful
                        wo-<lb break="no"/>man performed,&#x201D; added the missionary,<lb
                        break="yes"/>who gave us this sad narrative, &#x201C;the most<lb break="yes"
                    />robust Indian would not have ventured to<lb break="yes"/>undertake. She
                    traversed the woods at a<lb break="yes"/>season when the sky is constantly
                        covered<lb break="yes"/>with clouds, and the sun during whole<lb break="yes"
                    />days appears but for a few minutes. The<lb break="yes"/>course of the waters
                    affords her no indica-<lb break="no"/>tion by which to direct her way! The
                        in-<lb break="no"/>undations of the rivers forced her to go<lb break="yes"
                    />far from the banks of the main stream,<lb break="yes"/>through the midst of
                    woods, where the<lb break="yes"/>movement of the waters is almost imper-<lb
                        break="no"/>ceptible. How often must she have been<lb break="yes"/>stopped
                    by the thorny lianas, that form a<lb break="yes"/>
                    <cb/> net work around the trunks they entwine?<lb break="yes"/>How often must
                    she have swam across the<lb break="yes"/>rivulets, that run into the
                        Atabapo?&#x2014;<lb break="yes"/>This unfortunate woman was asked how<lb
                        break="yes"/>she had sustained herself during the four<lb break="yes"/>days?
                    She replied, that, exhausted with<lb break="yes"/>fatigue, she could find no
                    other nourish-<lb break="no"/>ment than those great black ants, called<lb
                        break="yes"/>vachacos, which climb the trees in long<lb break="yes"/>bands,
                    to suspend on them their resinous<lb break="yes"/>nests! We pressed the
                    missionary to tell us<lb break="yes"/>whether the Guahibi had, after these
                        unex-<lb break="no"/>ampled exertions, been allowed peaceably<lb break="yes"
                    />to enjoy the happiness of remaining with<lb break="yes"/>her children; and if
                    any repentance had<lb break="yes"/>followed this excess of cruelty, on the<lb
                        break="yes"/>part of her tormentors? He refused, how-<lb break="no"/>ever,
                    to satisfy our curiosity; but at our<lb break="yes"/>return from the Rio Negro,
                    we learnt, that<lb break="yes"/>the Indian mother had not even been al-<lb
                        break="no"/>lowed time to cure her wounds, but was<lb break="yes"/>again
                    separated from her children, and sent<lb break="yes"/>to one of the missions of
                    the Upper Oroo-<lb break="no"/>noko, where death afforded her a kind re-<lb
                        break="no"/>lease from her anxieties and sufferings. It<lb break="yes"
                    />appeared that the unfortunate creature had,<lb break="yes"/>at length, as is
                    the custom with all savage<lb break="yes"/>tribes in cases of overbearing
                        calamity,<lb break="yes"/>accelerated the approach of death, by re-<lb
