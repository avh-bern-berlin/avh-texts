    <p>Baron de Humboldt has addressed the following<lb/>
        note to the Berlin journals:&#x2014;&#x201C;Overwhelmed by the number<lb/>
        of letters sent me, which are increasing every day, amounting<lb/>
        to from 1,600 to 2,000 per annum&#x2014;many, too, being on the<lb/>
        most futile subjects, such as demands for my autograph and<lb/>
        offers to cure me of all diseases&#x2014;I once more make a<lb/>
        public appeal to the persons who wish me well, and request<lb/>
        them not to occupy themselves so much with what concerns<lb/>
        me, in order that with the diminution of strength, physical<lb/>
        and intellectual, which I experience, I may be allowed a little<lb/>
        leisure for study and composition. I trust that this step, to<lb/>
        which I have recourse with reluctance, will not be interpreted<lb/>
        unkindly.&#x201D;</p><lb/></body><back></back>
