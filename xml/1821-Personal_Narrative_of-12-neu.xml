                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>&#x201C;The river Atabapo displays every where<lb break="yes"/>a peculiar aspect;
                    you see nothing of its real<lb break="yes"/>banks formed by flat lands, eight or
                    ten feet<lb break="yes"/>high; they are concealed by a row of palms,<lb
                        break="yes"/>and small trees with slender trunks, the roots<lb break="yes"
                    />of which are bathed by the waters. There<lb break="yes"/>are many crocodiles
                    from the point where<lb break="yes"/>you quit the Oronoko to the mission of
                        San<lb break="yes"/>Fernando, and their presence indicates, as we<lb
                        break="yes"/>have said above, that this part of the river be-<lb break="no"
                    />longs to the Rio Guaviare and not to the Ata-<lb break="no"/>bapo. In the real
                    bed of the latter river above<lb break="yes"/>the mission of San Fernando, there
                    are no<lb break="yes"/>longer any crocodiles: we find there are some<lb
                        break="yes"/><hi rendition="#i">bavas</hi>, a great many fresh-water
                    dolphins, but<lb break="yes"/>no manatees. We also seek in vain on those<lb
                        break="yes"/>banks the thick-nosed tapir, the araguates, or<lb break="yes"
                    />great howling monkeys, the zamuro, or vultur<lb break="yes"/>aura, and the
                    crested pheasant, known by the<lb break="yes"/>name of <hi rendition="#i"
                        >guacharaca.</hi> Enormous water-snakes,<lb break="yes"/>in shape resembling
                    the boa, are unfortunately<lb break="yes"/>very numerous, and are dangerous to
                    the In-<lb break="no"/>dians who bathe. We saw them almost from<lb break="yes"
                    />the first day, swimming by the side of the ca-<lb break="no"/>noe; they were
                    at the most from 12 to 14 feet<lb break="yes"/>long. The jaguars of the banks of
                    the Ataha-<lb break="no"/>po and the Temi are large and well fed: they<lb
                        break="yes"/>are said, however, to be less daring than the<lb break="yes"
                    />jaguars of the Oronoko.&#x201D;</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>&#x201C;Before we reached its confluence, a grani-<lb break="no"/>tic hummock,
                    that rises on the western bank,<lb break="yes"/>near the mouth of the Guasacavi,
                    fixed our at-<lb break="no"/>tention; it is called the <hi rendition="#i">Rock
                        of the Guahiba<lb break="yes"/>woman</hi>, or the Rock of the Mother, <hi
                            rendition="#i">Piedra de</hi><lb break="yes"/><cb/><hi rendition="#i">la Madre.</hi> We inquired the
                    cause of so singu-<lb break="no"/>lar a denomination. Father Zea could not<lb
                        break="yes"/>satisfy our curiosity; but some weeks after,<lb break="yes"
                    />another missionary, one of the predecessors of<lb break="yes"/>this
                    ecclesiastic, whom we found settled at San<lb break="yes"/>Fernando as president
                    of the missions; related<lb break="yes"/>to us an event, which I recorded in my
                        journal<lb break="yes"/>and which excited in our minds the most pain-<lb
                        break="no"/>ful feelings. If, in these solitary scenes, man<lb break="yes"
                    />scarcely leaves behind him any trace of his<lb break="yes"/>existence, it is
                    doubly humiliating for a Euro-<lb break="no"/>pean to see perpetuated by the
                    name of a rock,<lb break="yes"/>by one of those imperishable monuments of<lb
                        break="yes"/>nature, the remembrance of the moral degra-<lb break="no"
                    />dation of our species, and the contrast between<lb break="yes"/>the virtue of
                    a savage, and the barbarism of<lb break="yes"/>civilized <choice><sic>mna</sic><corr type="editorial">man</corr></choice>!</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>&#x201C;In 1797 the missionary of San Fernando<lb break="yes"/>had led his
                    Indians to the banks of the Rio<lb break="yes"/>Guaviara, on one of those
                    hostile incursions,<lb break="yes"/>which are prohibited alike by religion and
                        the<lb break="yes"/>Spanish laws. They found an
                            <choice><sic>Italian</sic><corr type="editorial">Indian</corr></choice>
                    hut, a<lb break="yes"/>Guahiba mother with three children, two of<lb break="yes"
                    />whom were still infants. They were occupled<lb break="yes"/>in preparing the
                    flour of Cassava. Resistance<lb break="yes"/>was impossible; the father was gone
                    to fish,<lb break="yes"/>and the mother tried in vain to flee with her<lb
                        break="yes"/>children. Scarcely had she reached the sa-<lb break="no"
                    />vannah, when she was seized by the Indians of<lb break="yes"/>the mission, who
                    go to hunt men, like the<lb break="yes"/>whites and the negroes in Africa. The
                        mother<lb break="yes"/>and her children were bound, and dragged to<lb
                        break="yes"/>the bank of the river. The monk, seated in<lb break="yes"/>his
                    boat, waited the issue of the expedition, of<lb break="yes"/>which be partook
                    not the danger. Had the<lb break="yes"/>mother made too violent a resistance,
                    the In-<lb break="no"/>dians would have killed her, for every thing<lb
                        break="yes"/>is permitted when they go to the conquest of<lb break="yes"
                    />souls (<hi rendition="#i">a la conquista espiritula</hi>,) and it is chil-<lb
                        break="no"/>dren in particular they seek to capture, in or-<lb break="no"
                    />der to treat them, in the mission, as <hi rendition="#i">poitos</hi>, or<lb
                        break="yes"/>slaves of the Christians. The prisoners were<lb break="yes"
                    />carried to San Fernando in the hope, that the<lb break="yes"/>mother would not
                    find her way back to her<lb break="yes"/>home, by land. Far from those children
                        who<lb break="yes"/>had accompanied their father on the day in<lb
                        break="yes"/>which she had been carried off, this unhappy<lb break="yes"
                    />woman showed signs of the deepest despair.<lb break="yes"/>She attempted to
                    take back to her family the<lb break="yes"/>children who had been snatched away
                    by the<lb break="yes"/>missionary, and fled with them repeatedly from<lb
                        break="yes"/>the village of San Fernando, but the Indians<lb break="yes"
                    />never failed to seize her anew; and the mis-<lb break="no"/>sionary, after
                    having caused her to be merci-<lb break="no"/>lessly beaten, look the cruel
                    resolution of sepa-<lb break="no"/>rating the mother from the two children,
                        who<lb break="yes"/>had been carried off with her. She was con-<lb
                        break="no"/>veyed alone toward the mission of the Rio<lb break="yes"/>Negro,
                    going up the Atabapo. Slightly bound,<lb break="yes"/>she was seated at the bow
                    of the boat, ignorant<lb break="yes"/>of the fate that awaited her; but she
                        judged,<lb break="yes"/>by the direction of the sun, that she was remo-<lb
                        break="no"/>ved farther and farther from her hut and from<lb break="yes"
                    />her native country. She succeeded in break-<lb break="no"/>ing her bonds,
                    threw herself into the water, and<lb break="yes"/>swam to the left bank of the
                    Atabapo. The<lb break="yes"/>current carried her to a shelf of rock, which<lb
                        break="yes"/>bears her name to this day. She landed, and<lb break="yes"
                    />took shelter in the woods, but the president of<lb break="yes"/>the missions
                    ordered the Indians to row to the<lb break="yes"/>shore, and follow the traces
                    of the Guahibi.<lb break="yes"/>In the <choice><sic>evenin</sic><corr
                            type="editorial">evening</corr></choice> she was brought back.
                        Stretched<lb break="yes"/>upon the rock (<hi rendition="#i">la Piedra de la
                        Madre</hi>) a cruel<lb break="yes"/>punishment was inflicted on her with
                        those<lb break="yes"/>straps of manatee leather, which serve for<lb
                        break="yes"/>whips in that country, and with which the al-<lb break="no"
                    />cades are always furnished. This unhappy<lb break="yes"/>woman, her hands tied
                    behind her back with<lb break="yes"/>strong stalks of <hi rendition="#i"
                        >mavacure</hi>, was then dragged to<lb break="yes"/>the mission of
                    Javita.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>&#x201C;She was there thrown into one of the car-<lb break="no"/>ravanceras that
                    are called <hi rendition="#i">Casa del Rey.</hi> It<lb break="yes"/>was the
                    rainy season, and the night was pro-<lb break="no"/>foundly dark. Forests, till
                    then believed to be<lb break="yes"/>impenetrable, separated the mission of
                        Javita<lb break="yes"/>from that of San Fernando, which was twenty-<lb
                        break="hyph-yes"/>five leagues distant in a straight line. No<lb break="yes"
                    />other part is known than that of the rivers;<lb break="yes"/>no man ever
                    attempted to go by land from<lb break="yes"/>one village to another, were they
                    only a few<lb break="yes"/>leagues apart. But such difficulties do not<lb
                        break="yes"/>stop a mother, who is separated from her chil-<lb break="no"
                    />dren. Her children are at San Fernando de<lb break="yes"/>Atabapo; and she
                    must find them again, she<lb break="yes"/>must execute her project of delivering
                        them<lb break="yes"/>from the hands of Christians, of bringing them<lb
                        break="yes"/>back to their father on the banks of the Gua-<lb break="no"
                    />viare. The Guahibi was carelessly guarded<lb break="yes"/>in the caravansera.
                    Her arms, being woun-<lb break="no"/>ded, the Indians of Javita had loosened
                        her<lb break="yes"/>bonds, unknown to the missionary and the<lb break="yes"
                    />alcades. She succeeded by the help of her<lb break="yes"/>teeth in breaking
                    them entirely; disappeared<lb break="yes"/>during the night; and at the fourth
                    rising sun<lb break="yes"/>was seen at the mission of San Fernando, ho-<lb
                        break="no"/>vering around the hut where her children were<lb break="yes"
                    />confined. &#x201C;What that woman performed,&#x201D;<lb break="yes"/>added the
                    missionary who gave us this sad<lb break="yes"/>narrative, &#x201C;the most
                    robust Indian would not<lb break="yes"/>have ventured to undertake. She
                        traversed<lb break="yes"/>the woods at a season when the sky is cons-<lb
                        break="no"/>tantly covered with clouds, and the sun du-<lb break="no"/>ring
                    whole days appears but for a few minutes.<lb break="yes"/>Did the course of the
                    waters direct her way?<lb break="yes"/><cb/>The inundations of the rivers forced
                    her to go<lb break="yes"/>far from the banks of the main stream, through<lb
                        break="yes"/>the midst of woods where the movement of<lb break="yes"/>the
                    waters is almost imperceptible. How of-<lb break="no"/>ten must she have been
                    stopped by the thorny<lb break="yes"/>lianas, that form a net-work around the
                        trunks<lb break="yes"/>they entwine? How often must she have<lb break="yes"
                    />swam across the rivulets that run into the<lb break="yes"/>Atabapo! This
                    unfortunate woman was as-<lb break="no"/>ked how she had sustained herself
                    during the<lb break="yes"/>four days! She said, that, exhausted with<lb
                        break="yes"/>fatigue, she could find no other nourishment<lb break="yes"
                    />than those great black, ants called <hi rendition="#i">vachacos</hi>,<lb
                        break="yes"/>which climb the trees in long bands, to sus-<lb break="no"
                    />pend on them their resinous nests.&#x201D; We<lb break="yes"/>pressed the
                    missionary to tell us, whether the<lb break="yes"/>Guahibi had peacefully
                    enjoyed the happiness<lb break="yes"/>of remaining with her children; and if any
                        re-<lb break="no"/>pentance had followed this excess of cruelty.<lb
                        break="yes"/>He would not satisfy our curiosity; but at our<lb break="yes"
                    />return from the Rio Negro we learnt, that the<lb break="yes"/>Indian mother
                    was not allowed time to cure<lb break="yes"/>her wounds, but was again separated
                    from her<lb break="yes"/>children, and sent to one of the missions of the<lb
                        break="yes"/>Upper Oronoko. There she died, refusing all<lb break="yes"
                    />kinds of nourishment, as the savages do in<lb break="yes"/>great
                    calamities.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>&#x201C;Such is the remembrance annexed to this<lb break="yes"/>fatal rock, to <hi rendition="#i">Piedra de la Madre.</hi>&#x201D;</p>
