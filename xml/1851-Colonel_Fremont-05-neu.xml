<p>To honor him as a Pioneer of American Discovery,<lb/>the King of Prussia presented to Colonel <hi

                    in <lb/>the Sciences.&#x201D; The medal is of fine gold, massive,<lb/>more than
                    double the size of the American double<lb/>eagle, and of exquisite workmanship.
                    On the<lb/>face is the medallion head of the King, <hi rendition="#k"

    <lb/><p>&#x201C;<hi rendition="#i">To Col. Fremont, Senator,</hi></p><lb/><p>&#x201C;It is very agreeable to me, sir, to address you<lb/>these lines by my excellent friend,
                    our minister to the<lb/>United States, M. de Gerolt. After having given<lb/>you
                    in the new edition of my &#x2018;<hi rendition="#i">Aspects of
                    Nature,</hi>&#x2019;<lb/>the public testimony of the admiration which is
                    due<lb/>to your gigantic labors between St. Louis, of Mis-<lb/>souri, and the
                    coasts of the South Sea, I feel happy<lb/>to offer you, in this living token
                        (<hi rendition="#i">dans ce petit signe<lb/>de vie)</hi> the homage of my
                    warm acknowledgment.<lb/>You have displayed a noble courage in distant
                    expe-<lb/>ditions, braved all the dangers of cold and famine,<lb/>enriched all
                    the branches of the natural sciences, and il-<lb/>lustrated a vast country which
                    was almost entirely<lb/>unknown to us.</p><lb/>
    <p>&#x201C;A merit so rare has been acknowledged by a<lb/>sovereign warmly interested in the
                    progress of physi-<lb/>cal geography; the King orders me to offer you
                    the<lb/>grand golden medal destined to those who have la-<lb/>bored at
                    scientific progress. I hope that this mark<lb/>of the Royal good will, will be
                    agreeable to you at a<lb/>time when, upon the proposition of the
                    illustrious<lb/>geographer, Chas. Ritter, the Geographical Society<lb/>at
                    Berlin, has named you an honorary member. For<lb/>myself, I must thank you
                    particularly also for the<lb/>honor which you have done in attaching my
                    name<lb/>and that of my fellow-laborer and intimate friend, Mr.<lb/>Bonpland, to
                    countries neighboring to those which<lb/>have been the object of our labors. <hi

                        of slave-<lb/>ry, will be worthily represented by a friend of lib-<lb/>erty,

    <p>On the envelope thus addressed:<lb/><lb/>
        &#x201C;To Colonel Fremont, Senator,<lb/>
        &#x201C;With the great Golden Medal,<lb/>

    <lb/><p>The following is the public testimony of the Ba-<lb/>ron&#x2019;s admiration of the gigantic
                    labors of Fremont,<lb/>referred to in the letter, as contained in the new
                    or<lb/>third edition of his &#x201C;<hi rendition="#i">Aspects
                        of Nature,</hi>&#x201D; and which,<lb/>as a reference, becomes a natural
                    appendant to the<lb/>letter:</p><lb/><p>&#x201C;Fremont&#x2019;s map and geographical investigations<lb/>comprehend the extensive region
                    from the junction<lb/>of the Kansas river with the Missouri to the falls of
                    the<lb/>Columbia, and to the missions of Santa Barbara<lb/>and Puebla de los
                    Angelos, in New California; or a<lb/>space of 28 degrees of longitude, and from
                    the 34th<lb/>to the 45th parallel of latitude. Four hundred points<lb/>have been
                    determined hyposometrically by barome-<lb/>tric observation, and, for the most
                    part, geographi-<lb/>cally by astronomical observations; so that a
                    district<lb/>which, with the windings of the route, amounts to<lb/>3,600
                    geographical miles, from the mouth of the<lb/>Kansas to Fort Van Couver and the
                    shores of the<lb/>Pacific, (almost 720 miles more than the distance
                    from<lb/>Madrid to Tobolsk,) has been represented in profile,<lb/>showing the
                    relative heights above the level of the<lb/>sea.</p><lb/><p>&#x201C;As I was, I believe, the first person who under-<lb/>took to represent, in geognostic
                    profile, the form of<lb/>entire countries&#x2014;such as the Iberian peninsula,
                    the<lb/>high lands of Mexico, and the Cordilleras of South<lb/>America, (the
                    semi-perspective projections of a Sibe-<lb/>rian traveller the Abbe Chappe, were
                    founded on<lb/>mere and generally ill judged estimations of the fall<lb/>of
                    rivers)&#x2014;it has given me peculiar pleasure to see<lb/>the geographical
                    method of representing the form of<lb/>the earth in a vertical direction, or the
                    elevations of<lb/>the solid portion of our planet above its watery
                    cover-<lb/>ing, applied on so grand a scale as has been done
                    in<lb/>Fremont&#x2019;s map.</p>
