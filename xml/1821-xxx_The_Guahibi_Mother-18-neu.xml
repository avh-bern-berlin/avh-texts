                <p>
                    <hi rendition="#k">In</hi> 1797, the missionary of San Fernando had led his
                    Indians to<lb break="yes"/>the banks of the Rio Guaviare, on one of those
                    hostile incursions,<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="469" facs="#f0002"/> which are prohibited alike by religion and the
                    Spanish laws. They<lb break="yes"/>found in an Indian hut a Guahiba mother, with
                    three children, two<lb break="yes"/>of whom were still infants. They were
                    occupied in preparing the<lb break="yes"/>flour of cassava. Resistance was
                    impossible; the father was gone to<lb break="yes"/>fish, and the mother tried in
                    vain to flee with her children. Scarcely<lb break="yes"/>had she reached the
                    savanna, when she was seized by the Indians<lb break="yes"/>of the mission, who
                    go to hunt men, as the whites hunt the negroes<lb break="yes"/>in Africa. The
                    mother and her children were bound, and dragged<lb break="yes"/>to the bank of
                    the river. The monk, seated in his boat, waited the<lb break="yes"/>issue of an
                    expedition, of which he partook not the danger. Had<lb break="yes"/>the mother
                    made too violent a resistance, the Indians would have<lb break="yes"/>killed
                    her, for every thing is permitted when they go to the conquest<lb break="yes"
                    />of souls, (<hi rendition="#i">à lu conquista espiritual</hi>), and it is
                    children in particular they<lb break="yes"/>seek to capture, in order to treat
                    them in the mission as <hi rendition="#i">poitos</hi>, or<lb break="yes"/>slaves
                    of the Christians. The prisoners were carried to San Fernando,<lb break="yes"
                    />in the hope that the mother would be unable to find her way back to<lb
                        break="yes"/>her home by land. Far from those children who had
                        accompanied<lb break="yes"/>their father on the day in which she had been
                    carried off, this unhappy<lb break="yes"/>woman shewed signs of the deepest
                    despair. She attempted to take<lb break="yes"/>back to her family the children
                    who had been snatched away by the<lb break="yes"/>missionary, and fled with them
                    repeatedly from the village of San<lb break="yes"/>Fernando: but the Indians
                    never failed to seize her anew; and the<lb break="yes"/>missionary, after having
                    caused her to be mercilessly beaten, took the<lb break="yes"/>cruel resolution
                    of separating the mother from the two children who<lb break="yes"/>had been
                    carried off with her. She was conveyed alone toward the<lb break="yes"/>missions
                    of the Rio Negro, going up the Atabapo. Slightly bound,<lb break="yes"/>she was
                    seated at the bow of the boat, ignorant of the fate that<lb break="yes"/>awaited
                    her; but she judged, by the direction of the sun, that she<lb break="yes"/>was
                    removing farther and farther from her hut and her native country.<lb break="yes"
                    />She succeeded in breaking her bonds, threw herself into the water,<lb
                        break="yes"/>and swam to the left bank of the Atabapo. The current carried
                        her<lb break="yes"/>to a shelf or rock, which bears her name to this day.
                    She landed,<lb break="yes"/>and took shelter in the woods, but the president of
                    the missions ordered<lb break="yes"/>the Indians to row to the shore, and follow
                    the traces of the Guahiba.<lb break="yes"/>In the evening she was brought back.
                    Stretched upon the rock (<hi rendition="#i">la<lb break="yes"/>Piedra de la
                        Madre</hi>,) a cruel punishment was inflicted on her with<lb break="yes"
                    />those straps of manatee leather, which serve for whips in that country,<lb
                        break="yes"/>and with which the alcades are always furnished. This
                        unhappy<lb break="yes"/>woman, her hands tied behind her back with strong
                    stalks of <choice><sic><hi rendition="#i">maracure</hi></sic><corr
                            type="editorial"><hi rendition="#i">mavacure</hi></corr></choice>,<lb
                        break="yes"/>was then dragged to the mission of Javita.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>She was thrown into one of the caravanseras that are called
                            <choice><sic>Cassa</sic><corr type="editorial">Casa</corr></choice><lb
                        break="yes"/>del Rey. It was the rainy season, and the night was profoundly
                        dark.<lb break="yes"/>Forests, till then believed to be impenetrable,
                    separated the mission<lb break="yes"/>of Javita from that of San Fernando, which
                    was twenty-five leagues<lb break="yes"/>distant in a straight line. No other
                    path is known than that of the<lb break="yes"/>rivers; no man ever attempted to
                    go by land from one village to<lb break="yes"/>another, were they only a few
                    leagues apart. But such difficulties<lb break="yes"/>do not stop a mother who is
                    separated from her children. The<lb break="yes"/>Guahiba was carelessly guarded
                    in the caravansera; her arms being<lb break="yes"/>wounded, the Indians of
                    Javita had loosened her bonds, unknown to<lb break="yes"/>the missionary and the
                    alcades: she succeeded, by the help of her<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="470" facs="#f0003"/> teeth, in breaking them entirely; disappeared during
                    the night; and<lb break="yes"/>at the fourth rising sun was seen at the mission
                    of San Fernando, ho-<lb break="no"/>vering around the hut where her children
                    were confined. &#x201C;What<lb break="yes"/>that woman performed,&#x201D; added
                    the missionary who gave us this sad<lb break="yes"/>narrative, &#x201C;the most
                    robust Indian would not have ventured to under-<lb break="no"/>take. She
                    traversed the woods at a season when the sky is constantly<lb break="yes"
                    />filled with clouds, and the sun during whole days appeared but for<lb
                        break="yes"/>a few minutes. Did the course of the waters direct her way?
                        The<lb break="yes"/>inundations of the rivers forced her to go far from the
                    banks of the<lb break="yes"/>main stream, through the midst of woods, where the
                    movement of the<lb break="yes"/>waters is almost imperceptible. How often must
                    she have been stop-<lb break="no"/>ped by the thorny lianas, that form a network
                    round the trunks<lb break="yes"/>they entwine! How often must she have swum
                    across the rivulets<lb break="yes"/>that run into the Atabapo! This unfortunate
                    woman was asked how<lb break="yes"/>she had sustained herself during four days;
                    she said that, exhausted<lb break="yes"/>with fatigue, she could find no other
                    nourishment than those great<lb break="yes"/>black ants called <hi
                        rendition="#i">vachacos</hi>, which climb the trees in long bands, to<lb
                        break="yes"/>suspend on them their resinous nests.&#x201D; We pressed the
                        missionary<lb break="yes"/>to tell us whether the Guahiba had peacefully
                    enjoyed the happiness<lb break="yes"/>of remaining with her children; and if any
                    repentance had followed<lb break="yes"/>the excess of cruelty. He would not
                    satisfy our curiosity; but at<lb break="yes"/>our return from the Rio Negro, we
                    learnt that the Indian mother was<lb break="yes"/>not allowed time to cure her
                    wounds, but was again separated from<lb break="yes"/>her children, and sent to
                    one of the missions of the Upper Oroonoko.<lb break="yes"/>There she died,
                    refusing all kind of nourishment, as the savages do in<lb break="yes"/>great
                    calamities.</p>
