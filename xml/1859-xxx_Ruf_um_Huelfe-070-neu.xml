<p>Have you seen the characteristic, though kind, letter<lb/>which has just been published by the
                venerable philosopher<lb/>Alexander Von Humboldt, who is just verging on
                ninety<lb/>years of age? Here it is&#x2014;&#x201C;Burdened by an
                every-day<lb/>growing correspondence, which in the mean amounts to from<lb/>1,600 to
                2,000 numbers per annum&#x2014;(letters, books and<lb/>pamphlets, on subjects
                completely uninteresting to me;<lb/>manuscripts about which I am asked to give my
                advice;<lb/>projects of emigration and colonisation; specimens of models<lb/>of
                machinery, and of objects of natural history; questions<lb/>about aerostats; demands
                for autographs; offers to nurse and<lb/>to amuse me, &#x0026;c.)&#x2014;I try once
                more, by means of this public<lb/>notice, to invite persons who really have any
                regard for me<lb/>not to occupy themselves so much with my person, on this<lb/>and
                on the other side of the Atlantic; and, above all, not to<lb/>make a post-office of
                my house. I feel but too much al-<lb/>ready the diminution of my mental and physical
                powers,<lb/>and a little rest and leisure after my day&#x2019;s work is
                abso-<lb/>lutely necessary to me. And may this appeal, to which I<lb/>have been
                driven by direct necessity, not be unkindly taken.</p><lb/><closer><salute>&#x2014;<hi rendition="#k">Alexander von Humboldt.</hi>&#x2014;</salute></closer><dateline>Berlin, March 15, 1859.&#x201D;</dateline><lb/></body><back></back>
