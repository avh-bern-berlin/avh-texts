<div n="1"><head><hi rendition="#i">MRS. IDA PFEIFFER&#x2014;LETTER FROM HUMBOLDT.</hi></head><lb/><p><hi rendition="#c">From the London Morning Star.</hi></p><lb/><p><hi rendition="#k">Mrs. Ida Pfeiffer</hi>, the celebrated lady traveller, who<lb/>went twice round the world, is now again in London, on<lb/>her way to Madagascar, into the interior of which she<lb/>wishes to penetrate and explore. Her most recent tra-<lb/>vels extended over Germany, but she does not find in the<lb/>civilized parts of the world the same interest as in the<lb/>less cultivated regions. There, in the bosom of nature,<lb/>undisturbed by the presence of man, she delights most.</p><lb/><p>On this her last visit to the European continent, some of<lb/>the most distinguished men came forward, unsolicited, to<lb/>do her honour. In Berlin and Amsterdam, the Society<lb/>of Natural History conferred upon her their respective<lb/>diplomas, and elected her an honorary member. The<lb/>King of Prussia graciously invited her to his residence<lb/>at Potsdam, and presented her with the golden medal of<lb/>the Humboldt order for arts and sciences. The greatest<lb/>living naturalist and philosopher, Alexander von Hum-<lb/>boldt, exhibited in her favour the warmest friendship and<lb/>admiration. As a token of the affectionate interest he<lb/>took in her welfare, he presented her, on parting, with an<lb/>autograph letter, of which the following is a literal<lb/>translation:</p><lb/><p>&#x201C;All those who, in different regions of the earth,<lb/>preserve a remembrance of my name
                    and affection for my<lb/>works, I earnestly beg to receive, with friendly
                    interest,<lb/>and to aid with their counsels, the bearer of these
                    lines,<lb/>Mrs. Ida Pfeiffer, celebrated not only for the noble<lb/>constancy
                    that, amidst so many dangers and privations,<lb/>led her twice round the globe,
                    but, above all, for the ami-<lb/>able simplicity and modesty pervading her
                    works, the<lb/>truthfulness and philanthropy of her judgment, as well as<lb/>the
                    independence, and at the same time the delicacy, of<lb/>her sentiments. Enjoying
                    the confidence and friendship<lb/>of this respectable lady, I blame her for,
                    though I cannot<lb/>refrain from admiring, that idomitable energy of
                    charac-<lb/>ter which she displayed wherever called&#x2014;I should
                    say,<lb/>impelled by an unconquerable passion of exploring nature<lb/>and the
                    habits of the various human races. As the<lb/>oldest living traveller, I feel a
                    desire to offer to Mrs. Ida<lb/>Pfeiffer this slender proof of my high and
                    respectful<lb/>esteem.</p><closer><salute><hi rendition="#k">Alexander Humboldt.</hi></salute></closer><lb/><dateline>&#x201C;Potsdam City Castle, June 8, 1856.&#x201D;</dateline><lb/>

                    <div><p>Mrs. Ida Pfeiffer might justly be proud of so very<lb/>flattering a testimony from one of the most eminent men<lb/>living, but her modesty is equal to her good sense, tact,<lb/>patience, perseverance, power of endurance and simple<lb/>habits.</p><lb/><p>A special Providence seems to have watched over<lb/>this extraordinary woman. She has been preserved amid<lb/>untold dangers and perils of sea and land. That a deli-<lb/>cate woman, unarmed, unknown and poor, with no pres-<lb/>tige of aristocratic descent, without the magic of an ample<lb/>exchequer, should twice have girded the world, unharmed<lb/>and unscathed, and accomplish, unaided and single, what<lb/>the most reckless man who scaled the bloody heights of<lb/>the Alma might have shrunk from appalled, seems almost<lb/>incredible.</p><lb/><p>Is this not an abundant testimony, then, that deadly<lb/>weapons are absolutely unnecessary for protection? And<lb/>may not nations learn from this fact, tested under the<lb/>very longitude and lattiude of the earth, that if they were<lb/>to confide in the protecting power of Providence and not<lb/>in gunpowder, there would be an end of maintaining<lb/>standing armies and men trained to the use of arms,<lb/>which, perhaps, more than any other cause, provoke wars<lb/>and bloody conflicts amongst mankind?</p><lb/><p>An irresistible impulse impels this wonderful lady to<lb/>wander over God&#x2019;s vast and beautiful world, and to visit<lb/>the great variety of the races of men. Not the least<lb/>wonderful part of her adventures is the way in which she<lb/>communicates with the various peoples, some of whom<lb/>she found in the least developed stage of nature. For she<lb/>is assisted by an extraordinary power of expressing her<lb/>wants and thoughts by mimicry&#x2014;a kind of natural lan-<lb/>guage of universal interpretation.</p><lb/><p>It might be imagined that, in order to perform such<lb/>stupendous travels, Mrs. Ida Pfeiffer must be in posses-<lb/>sion of a large fortune, whereas her only pecuniary re-<lb/>sources are vested in the produce of her literary works.<lb/>When in this way a modest sum has accumulated in the<lb/>hands of her publishers, she again sets out to visit some<lb/>unexplored part of the world, to return when her means<lb/>are exhausted.</p><lb/><p>Several editions of her works, translated into the<lb/>English language, have found extensive public favour in<lb/>England and America. Her last travel round the world,<lb/>by far the most interesting of her literary productions,<lb/>has been edited by Messrs. Orme and Longmans.</p><lb/><p>She is now waiting to meet with a suitable vessel to<lb/>carry her to the Cape of Good Hope or to the Mauritius,<lb/>and thence to Madagascar. May her wishes be fulfilled,<lb/>and may the same good fortune which hitherto accom-<lb/>panied her, follow her in her future travels, and in due<lb/>time procure us again the pleasure of another of her very<lb/>interesting and instructive descriptions of foreign coun-<lb/>tries and peoples.</p></div><lb/></body><back></back>
