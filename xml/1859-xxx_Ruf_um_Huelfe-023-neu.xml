<p>Baron de Humboldt has addressed the follow-<lb/>ing note to the Berlin
                journals:&#x2014;Overwhelmed by the<lb/>number of letters sent me, and which are
                increasing<lb/>every day, amounting to from 1,600 to 2,000 per annum;<lb/>many, too,
                being on the most futile subjects, such as de-<lb/>mands for my autograph, and
                offers to cure me of all<lb/>diseases; I once more make a public appeal to the
                per-<lb/>sons who wish me well, and request them not to occupy<lb/>themselves so
                much with what concerns me, in order that<lb/>with the diminution of strength,
                physical and intellec-<lb/>tual, which I experience, I may be allowed a little
                lei-<lb/>sure for study and composition. I trust that this step,<lb/>to which I have
                recourse with reluctance, will not be in-<lb/>terpreted unkindly.</p><lb/></body><back></back>
