            <head><hi rendition="#c"><hi rendition="#k">LIFE OF ANIMALS IN THE PRIM&#x00E6;VAL<lb/>FOREST.</hi></hi></head>
            <lb/>
            <p><hi rendition="#k">If</hi> we comprehend in one general view the wooded region<lb/>which includes the whole of the interior of South Ame-<lb/>rica, from the grassy steppes of Venezuela (<hi rendition="#i">los Llanos de<lb/>Caracas</hi>) to the Pampas of Buenos Ayres, or from eight<lb/>degrees North to nineteen degrees South latitude, we<lb/>shall perceive that this connected forest of the tropical<lb/>zone has an extent unequalled in any other portion of the<lb/>earth&#x2019;s surface. Its area is about twelve times that of<lb/>Germany. Traversed in all directions by systems of<lb/>rivers, in which the minor and tributary streams some-<lb/>times exceed our Rhine or our Danube in the abundance<lb/>of their waters, it owes the wonderful luxuriance of the<lb/>growth of its trees to the combined influence of great<lb/>moisture and high temperature. In the temperate zone,</p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
                and especially in Europe and Nothern Asia, forests may<lb/>be named from particular genera or species, which, grow-<lb/>ing together as social plants (<hi rendition="#i">plant&#x00E6; sociales</hi>), from se-<lb/>parate and distinct woods. In the Northern forests of<lb/>oaks, pines, and birches, and in the Eastern forests of<lb/>limes or linden trees, usually only one species of amenta-<lb/>ce&#x00E6;, conifer&#x00E6;, or tiliace&#x00E6;, prevails or is predominant;<lb/>sometimes a single species of needle-trees is intermingled<lb/>with the foliage of trees of other classes. Tropical forests,<lb/>on the other hand, decked with thousands of flowers, are<lb/>strangers to such uniformity of association; the exceed-<lb/>ing variety of their flora renders it vain to ask of what<lb/>trees the prim&#x00E6;val forest consists. A countless number<lb/>of families are here crowded together, and even in small<lb/>spaces individuals of the same species are rarely asso-<lb/>ciated. Each day, and at each change of place, new forms<lb/>present themselves to the traveller, who, however, often<lb/>finds that he cannot reach the blossoms of trees whose<lb/>leaves and ramifications had previously arrested his at-<lb/>tention.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rivers, with their countless lateral arms, afford<lb/>the only routes by which the country can be traversed.<lb/>Between the Orinoco, the Cassiquiare, and the Rio Negro,<lb/>astronomical observations, and, where these were wanting,<lb/>determinations by compass of the direction of the rivers,<lb/>respectively showed us, that two lonely mission villages<lb/>might be only a few miles apart, and yet that the Monks,<lb/>when they whished to visit each other, could only do so by<lb/>spending a day and a half in following the windings of<lb/>small streams, in canoes hollowed out of the trunks of<lb/>trees. A striking evidence of the impenetrability of par-<lb/>ticular parts of the forest is afforded by a trait, related by<lb/>an Indian, of the habits of the large American tiger, or<lb/>panther-like jaguar. While in the Llanos of Varinas and<lb/>the Meta, and in the Pampas at Buenos Ayres, the intro-<lb/>duction of European cattle, horses, and mules has enabled<lb/>the beasts of prey to find an abundant subsistence&#x2014;so<lb/>that, since the first discovery of America, their numbers<lb/>have increased exceedingly in those extended and treeless<lb/>grassy steppes&#x2014;their congeners in the dense forests around<lb/>the sources of the Orinoco lead a very different and far<lb/>less easy life. In a bivouac, near the junction of the Cassi-<lb/>quiare with the Orinoco, we had had the misfortune of<lb/>losing a large dog, to which we were much attached, as<lb/>the most faithful and affectionate companion of our wan-<lb/>derings. Being still uncertain whether he had been ac-<lb/>tually killed by the tigers, a faint hope of recovering him<lb/>induced us, in returning from the mission of Esmeralda<lb/>through the swarms of musquitoes by which it is infested,<lb/>to spend another night at the spot where we had so long<lb/>sought him in vain. We heard the cries of the jaguar,<lb/>probably the very individual which we suspected of the<lb/>deed, extremely near to us; and, as the clouded sky made<lb/>astronomical observations impossible, we passed part of<lb/>the night in making our interpreter (lenguaraz) repeat to<lb/>us the accounts given by our native boat&#x2019;s crew of the<lb/>tigers of the country.
            </p>
            <p>
                The &#x201C;black jaguar&#x201D; was, they (the boat&#x2019;s crew) said,<lb/>not unfrequently found there; it is the largest and most<lb/>bloodthirst variety, with black spots scarcely distinguish-<lb/>able on its deep dark-brown skin. It lives at the foot of<lb/>the mountains of Maraguaca and Unturan. One of the<lb/>Indians of the Durimund tribe then related to us, that<lb/>jaguars are often led, by their love of wandering and by<lb/>their rapacity, to lose themselves in such impenetrable<lb/>parts of the forest, that they can no longer hunt along the<lb/>ground, and live instead in the trees, where they are the<lb/>terror of the families of monkeys and of the prehensile-<lb/>tailed vivera, the Cereoleptes. I borrow these notices from<lb/>journals written at the time in German, and which were<lb/>not entirely exhausted in the narrative of my travels, which<lb/>I published in the French language. They contain a de-<lb/>tailed description of the nocturnal life, or, perhaps, I<lb/>might rather say the nocturnal voices of the wild animals<lb/>in the forests of the torrid zone; which appears to me<lb/>particularly suited to form part of a work bearing the<lb/>title of the presented volumes. That which is written down<lb/>on the spot, either in the immediate presence of the phe-<lb/>nomena, or soon after the reception of the impressions<lb/>which they produce, may, at least, lay claim to more life<lb/>and freshness than can be expected in recollections.
            </p>
            <p>
                Descending from West to East the Rio Apure, the<lb/>overflowings of whose waters, and the inundations pro-<lb/>duced by them, were noticed in the chapter on Steppes<lb/>and Deserts, we arrived at its junction with the Orinoco. It<lb/>was the season of low water, and the average breadth of<lb/>the Apure was only a little more than twelve hundred<lb/>English feet, yet I found the Orinoco, at the confluence of<lb/>the two rivers, not far from the granite rock of Curiquima,<lb/>where I was able to measure a base line, still upwards of<lb/>11,430 French (12,180 English) feet wide. Yet this point,<lb/><hi rendition="#i">i. e.</hi>, the Rock of Curiquima, is four hundred geographical<lb/>miles in a straight line from the sea and from the Delta of<lb/>the Orinoco. Part of the plains watered by the Apure<lb/>and the Pagara are inhabited by tribes of the Yaruros<lb/>and Achaguas, who, as they persist in maintaining their<lb/>independence, are called savages, in the mission villags<lb/>established by the Monks; their manners, however, are<lb/>scarcely more rude than those of the Indians of the vil-<lb/>lages&#x2014;who, although baptized and living &#x201C;under the bell&#x201D;<lb/>(<hi rendition="#i">baxo la compana</hi>), are still almost entirely untaught and<lb/>uninstructed.
            </p>
            <p>
                On leaving the Island del Diamante, in which Zambos<lb/>who speak Spanish, cultivate sugar-canes, we entered on<lb/>scenes of nature characterised by wildness and grandeur.<lb/>The air was filled with countless flocks of flamingoes<lb/>(Ph&#x0153;nicopterus) and other water birds, which appeared<lb/>against the blue sky like a dark cloud with continually<lb/>varying outlines. The river had here narrowed to between<lb/>900 and 1,000 feet; and, flowing in a perfectly straight<lb/>line, formed a kind of canal, enclosed on either side by<lb/>dense wood. The margin of the forest presents, at this<lb/>part, a singular appearance. In front of the almost im-<lb/>penetrable wall of giant trunks of c&#x00E6;salpinia, cedrela,<lb/>and desmanthus, there rises, from the sandy river beach,<lb/>with the greatest regularity, a low hedge of sauso, only<lb/>four feet high, consisting of a small shrub, hermesia cas-<lb/>taneifolia, which forms a new genus of the family of<lb/>euphorbiace&#x00E6;. Some slender thorny palms, called, by<lb/>the Spaniards, piritu and coroso, (perhaps species of mar-<lb/>tinezia and bactris), stand next; and the whole resembles<lb/>a close, well-pruned garden hedge, having only occasional<lb/>openings, at considerable distances from each other, which<lb/>have doubtless been made by the large four-footed beasts<lb/>of the forest to gain easy access to the river. One sees,<lb/>more especially in the early morning and at sunset, the<lb/>American tiger or jaguar, the tapir, and the peccary, lead<lb/>their young through these openings to the river to drink.<lb/>When startled by the passing canoe, they do not attempt<lb/>to regain the forest by breaking forcibly through the<lb/>hedge which has been described, but one has the pleasure<lb/>of seeing these wild animals stalk leisurely along, between<lb/>the river and the hedge, for four or five hundred paces,<lb/>until they leave have reached the nearest opening, when they<lb/>disappear through it. In the course of an almost unin-<lb/>terrupted river navigation of 1,520 geographical miles on<lb/>the Orinoco, to near its sources, on the Cassiquiare, and<lb/>on the Rio Negro&#x2014;and during which we were confined<lb/>for seventy-four days, to a small canoe&#x2014;we enjoyed the<lb/>repetition of the same spectacle at several different points,<lb/>and, I may add, always with new delight. There came<lb/>down together, to drink, to bathe, or to fish, groups, con-<lb/>sisting of the most different classes of animals, the larger<lb/>mammalia being associated with many coloured herons,<lb/>palamedeas, and proudly-stepping curassow, and cashew<lb/>birds (Crax Alector and C. Pauxi). &#x201C;<hi rendition="#i">Es como en el<lb/>Paradiso;</hi>&#x201D; &#x201C;it is here, as in Paradise,&#x201D; said, with a pious air,<lb/>our steersman, and old Indian, who had been brought up in<lb/>the house of an Ecclestatic. The peace of the golden<lb/>age was, however, far from prevailing among the animals<lb/>of this American paradise, which carefully watched and<lb/>avoided each other. The capybara, a cavy three or four<lb/>feet long (a magnified repetition of the Brazilian cavy,<lb/>cuvia aguti), is devoured, in the river, by the crocodiles,<lb/>and, on shore, by the tiger. It runs so indifferently, that<lb/>we were, several times, able to catch individuals from<lb/>among the numerous herds which presented themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below the mission of Santa Barbara de Arichuna, we<lb/>passed the night, as usual, under the open sky, on a sandy<lb/>flat on the bank of the Rio Apure, closely bordered by the<lb/>impenetrable forest. It was not without difficulty that we<lb/>succeeded in finding dry wood to kindle the fire with which<lb/>it is always customary, in that country, to surround a bi-<lb/>vouac, in order to guard against the attacks of the jaguar.<lb/>The night was humid, mild, and moonlight. Several<lb/>crocodiles approached the shore; I think I have observed<lb/>these animals to be attracted by fire, like our cray-fish,<lb/>and many other inhabitants of the water. The oars of our<lb/>boat were placed upright, and carefully driven into the<lb/>ground, to form poles from which our hammocks could be<lb/>suspended. Deep stillness prevailed; only, from time to<lb/>time, we heard the blowing of the fresh-water dolphins,<lb/>which are peculiar to the Orinoco net-work of rivers (and,<lb/>according to Colebroke, to the Ganges, as far as Benares),<lb/>which followed each other in long lines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Soon after eleven o&#x2019;clock, such a disturbance began<lb/>to be heard in the adjoining forest, that, for the remainder<lb/>of the night, all sleep was impossible. The wild cries of<lb/>animals appeared to rage throughout the forest. Among<lb/>the many voices which resounded together, the Indians<lb/>could only recognise those which, after short pauses in the<lb/>general uproar, were first heard singly. There was the<lb/>monotonous howling of the aluates (the howling monkeys);<lb/>the plaintive, soft, and almost flute-like tones of the small<lb/>sapajous; the snorting grumblings of the striped nocturnal<lb/>monkey (the Nyetipithicus trivirgatus, which I was the<lb/>first to describe); the interrupted cries of the great tiger,<lb/>the cuguar or maneless America lion, the peccary, the<lb/>sloth, and a host of parrots, of parraquas, and other phea-<lb/>sant-like birds. When the tigers came near the edge of<lb/>the forest, our dog, which had before barked incessantly,<lb/>came howling to seek refuge under our hammocks. Some-<lb/>times the cry of the tiger was heard to proceed from<lb/>amidst the high branches of a tree, and was, in such case,<lb/>always accompanied by the plaintive piping of the monkeys,<lb/>who were seeking to escape from the unwonted pursuit.  
            </p>
            <p>
                If one asks the Indians why this incessant noise and<lb/>disturbance arises on particular nights, they answer, with<lb/>a smile, that &#x201C;the animals were rejoicing in the bright<lb/>moonlight, and keeping the feast of the full moon.&#x201D; To<lb/>me it appeared that the scene had probably originated in<lb/>some accidental combat, and that hence the disturbance<lb/>had spread to other animals, and thus the noise had in-<lb/>creased more and more. The jaguar pursues the pecca-<lb/>ries and tapirs, and these, pressing against each other in<lb/>their flight, break through the interwoven tree-like<lb/>shrubs which impede their escape; the apes on the tops<lb/>of the trees, being frightened by the crash, join their<lb/>cries to those of the larger animals; this arouses the<lb/>tribes of birds, who build their nests in communities, and<lb/>thus the whole animals world becomes in a state of commo-<lb/>tion. Longer experience taught us that it is by no means<lb/>always the celebration of the brightness of the moon<lb/>which disturbs the respose of the woods. We witnessed<lb/>the same occurrence repeatedly, and found that the voices<lb/>were loudest during violent falls of rain, or when, with<lb/>loud peals of thunder, the flashing lightning illuminated<lb/>the deep recesses of the forest.
