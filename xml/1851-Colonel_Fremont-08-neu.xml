                <p>Among the scientific honors paid to Colonel<lb/>Fremont, as a pioneer of American
                    discovery,<lb/>certainly not the least notable was that confer-<lb/>red by the
                    King of Prussia in &#x201C;the great Golden<lb/>Medal of Progress in the
                    Science.&#x201D; The manner<lb/>of its communication added a rare value to
                    the<lb/>gift. It was sent with a most complimentary<lb/>letter of Baron
                    Humboldt, who took occasion to<lb/>add the warmest expressions of his own
                    person-<lb/>al respect and admiration. As this letter has<lb/>apparently been
                    overlooked in the notices re-<lb/>cently made of Fremont by the press, we
                    avail<lb/>ourselves of the advance sheets of the new Biog-<lb/>raphy in the
                    course of publication by Derby &amp;<lb/>Co., of New York, to lay it before our
                    readers.<lb/>One sentence of Humboldt&#x2019;s letter we have<lb/>marked in
                    italics; it was a conscientious tribute<lb/>paid to the Senator then; it is
                    highly significant<lb/>of <choice>

                <p>The following is the English translation of<lb/>Baron Humboldt&#x2019;s
                    letter:</p>

                <p>&#x201C;<hi rendition="#i">To Colonel Fremont, Senator:</hi></p>
                <lb/>
                <p>&#x201C;It is very agreeable to me, sir, to address<lb/>you these lines by my
                    excellent friend, our min-<lb/>ister to the United States, M. de Gerolt.
                    After<lb/>having given you in the new edition of my &#x2018;As-<lb/>pects of
                    Nature&#x2019; the public testimony of the ad-<lb/>miration which is due to your
                    gigantic labors be-<lb/>tween St. Louis, of Missouri, and the coast of<lb/>the
                    South Sea, I feel happy to offer you, in this<lb/>living token (<hi
                        rendition="#i">dans ce petit signe de vie</hi>) the hom-<lb/>age of my warm
                    ackowledgment. You have<lb/>displayed a noble courage in distant
                    expeditions,<lb/>braved all the dangers of cold and famine, en-<lb/>riched all
                    the branches of the natural sciences,<lb/>illustrated a vast country which was
                    almost en-<lb/>tirely unknown to us.</p>
                <lb/>
                <p>&#x201C;A merit so rare has been acknowledged by<lb/>a sovereign warmly
                    interested in the progress of<lb/>physical geography; the King orders me to
                    offer<lb/>you the grand golden medal destined to those<lb/>who have labored at
                    scientific progress. I hope<lb/>that this mark of the Royal good will, will
                    be<lb/>agreeable to you at a time when, upon the prop-<lb/>position of the
                    illustrious geographer, Chas. Rit-<lb/>ter, the Geographical Society at Berlin
                    has nam-<lb/>ed you an honorary member. For myself, I<lb/>must thank you
                    particularly also for the honor<lb/>which you have done in attaching my name
                    and<lb/>and that my fellow-laborer and intimate friend,<lb/>Mr. Bonpland, to
                    countries neighboring to those<lb/>when have been the object of our
                        labors.&#x2014;<lb/><hi rendition="#i">California, which has so nobly
                        resisted the intro-<lb/>duction of slavery, will be worthily represented
                        by<lb/>a friend of liberty and of the progress of
                    intelli-<lb/>gence.</hi></p>

                <p>The following is the public testimony of the<lb/>Baron&#x2019;s admiration of the
                    gigantic labors of<lb/>Fremont, referred to in the letter, as contained<lb/>in
                    the new or third edition of his Aspects of<lb/>Nature, and which, as a
                    reference, becomes a<lb/>natural appendant to the letter:</p>
                <lb/>
                <p>&#x201C;Fremont&#x2019;s map and geographical investiga-<lb/>tions comprehend the
                    extensive region trom the<lb/>junction of the Kansas river with the
                    Missouri<lb/>to the falls of the Columbia, and to the missions<lb/>of Santa
                    Barbara and Puebla de los Angelos, in<lb/>New California; or a space of 28
                    degrees of lon-<lb/>gitude, and from the 34th to the 45th parallel
                    of<lb/>latitude. Four hundred points have been de-<lb/>termined hyposometrically
                    by barometic obser-<lb/>vations, and, for the most part, geographically<lb/>by
                    astronomical observations; so that a district<lb/>which, with the windings of
                    the route, amounts<lb/>to 3,600 geographical miles, from the mouth of<lb/>the
                    Kansas to Fort Van Couver and the shores<lb/>of the Pacific, (almost 720 miles
                    more than the<lb/>distance from Madrid to Tobolsk,) has been rep-<lb/>resented
                    in profile, showing the relative heights<lb/>above the level of the sea.</p>
                <lb/>
                <p>&#x201C;As I was, I believe, the first person who un-<lb/>dertook to represent,
                    in geognostic profile, the<lb/>form of entire countries&#x2014;such as the
                    Iberian<lb/>peninsula, the high lands of Mexico, and the<lb/>Cordilleras of

                    has<lb/>given me peculiar pleasure to see the geographical<lb/>method of
                    representing the form of the earth in<lb/>a vertical direction, or the
                    elevations of the solid<lb/>portion of our planet above its watery
                    covering,<lb/>applied on so grand a scale as has been done
