                    </choice> by the Audiencia of Caraccas, cannot be exe-<lb/>cuted for want of a
                    hangman. In these cases,<lb/>the barbarous custom is observed of
                    pardoning<lb/>one criminal on condition of his hanging the<lb/>others. Our
                    guides related to us that, a short<lb/>time before our arrival on the coast of
                    Cumana,<lb/>a Zambo, known for the ferocity of his manners,<lb/>determined to
                    screen himself from punishment<lb/>by turning executioner. The preparations
                    for<lb/>the execution, however, shook his resolution&#x2014;he<lb/>felt a horror
                    of himself, and preferring death to<lb/>the disgrace of thus saving his life, he
                    called<lb/>again for his irons, which had been struck off.&#x2014;<lb/>He did
                    not long remain in prison, and he under-<lb/>went his sentence through the
                    baseness of one of<lb/>his accomplices. This awakening of a sentiment<lb/>of
                    honour in the soul of a murderer is a psycho-<lb/>logic phenomenon worthy of
                    reflection. The<lb/>man who had so often shed the blood of travellers<lb/>in the
                    plains, recoiled at the idea of becoming the<lb/>passive instrument of justice
                    in inflicting upon<lb/>others a punishment which he felt that he
                        himself<lb/>deserved.&#x2014;<hi rendition="#k">Humboldt&#x2019;s
