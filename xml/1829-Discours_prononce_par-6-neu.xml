In a discourse pronoun-<lb break="no"/>ced at the Extraordinary sitting of the Imperial Academy of<lb break="yes"/>Sciences of St Petersburg, held on the 28th November 1829.<lb break="yes"/>By Baron <hi rendition="#k" >Alexander de Humboldt</hi>
                    <note place="foot" n="*">We are glad to be able to lay before our readers the very eloquent<lb break="yes"/>discourse of this distinguished traveller and philosopher, who has been so<lb break="yes"/>kind as to favour us thus early with a copy of it. It was printed by or-<lb break="no"/>der of the Academy of Sciences.</note>.</head>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rendition="#k">If</hi>, in this solemn assembly, which evinces so noble a desire to<lb break="yes"/>honour the labours of human intelligence, I venture to solicit<lb break="yes"/>your indulgence, it is only to fulfil a duty which you have im-<lb break="no"/>posed upon me. When I had returned to my native country,<lb break="yes"/>after having travelled over the frozen crest of the Cordilleras<lb break="yes"/>and the forests of the lower equinoxial regions,&#x2014;when I was re-<lb break="no"/>stored to agitated Europe, after having for a long time enjoyed<lb break="yes"/>the calm of nature, and the imposing aspect of savage fertility,<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="287" facs="#f0002"/> I received from this illustrious Academy, as a public mark of<lb break="yes"/>its favour, the honour of being made one of its members.<lb break="yes"/>Even now it is agreeable to look back to that epoch of my life<lb break="yes"/>when that same eloquent voice which you have heard at the<lb break="yes"/>opening of this meeting, called me among you, and almost per-<lb break="no"/>suaded me, by ingenious fictions, that I had deserved the palm<lb break="yes"/>which you had given me. How little could I then conjecture<lb break="yes"/>that I should again sit under your presidency, after having re-<lb break="no"/>turned from the banks of the Irtish, from the confines of<lb break="yes"/>China, Songaria, and the borders of the Caspian Sea! By a<lb break="yes"/>fortunate combination of events, in the course of a troubled and<lb break="yes"/>sometimes laborious life, I have been able to compare the auri-<lb break="no"/>ferous soil of the Oural and of New Granada; the elevated<lb break="yes"/>formations of porphyry and trachyte of Mexico, with those of<lb break="yes"/>the Altai, and the Savannahs <hi rendition="#i" >(Llanos)</hi> of the Orinoco, with the<lb break="yes"/>Steppes of Southern Siberia, which present a vast field for the<lb break="yes"/>peaceable conquest of agriculture and to the arts of industry,<lb break="yes"/>which, while they enrich nations, soften their manners, and gra-<lb break="no"/>dually ameliorate the condition of society.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>I have been able partly to carry the same instruments, or<lb break="yes"/>those of a similar but improved construction, to the banks of the<lb break="yes"/>Obi and the Amazon, during the long interval which has se-<lb break="no"/>parated my two journeys, the aspect of the physical sciences,<lb break="yes"/>particularly of geognosy, chemistry, and the electro-magnetic<lb break="yes"/>theory, has been considerably changed. New apparatus, I had<lb break="yes"/>almost ventured to say, new organs have been created, to bring<lb break="yes"/>man into the most intimate contact with the mysterious forces<lb break="yes"/>which animate the work of creation, and of which the unequal<lb break="yes"/>struggle, and the apparent perturbations are subject to eternal<lb break="yes"/>laws. If modern travellers are able to observe in a short time<lb break="yes"/>a great part of the surface of the globe, it is to the progress of<lb break="yes"/>the mathematical and physical sciences, to the precision of in-<lb break="no" />struments, to the improvement of methods, and to the art of<lb break="yes" />grouping facts and raising them to general laws, that they owe<lb break="yes" />the advantages which they enjoy. The traveller who is fitted<lb break="yes" />for observation, is he, who, by the valuable influence of Aca-<lb break="no" />demies, and by the pursuits of a sedentary life, has been pre-<lb break="no" />pared in the silence of his study. In order to form an accu-<lb break="no" />rate judgment of the merit of travellers of different periods, we<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="288" facs="#f0003"/> must be acquainted with the simultaneous progress of practi-<lb break="no"/>cal astronomy, geognosy, meteorology and natural history.<lb break="yes"/>It is thus that the more or less flourishing cultivation of the<lb break="yes"/>great domain of science ought to reflect itself in the traveller<lb break="yes"/>who wishes to rise to the level of his age; and that voyages<lb break="yes"/>undertaken to extend the physical knowledge of the globe,<lb break="yes"/>ought, at different periods, to present an individual character,&#x2014;<lb break="yes"/>the physiognomy of a given epoch,&#x2014;and that they ought to be<lb break="yes"/>the expression of the state of cultivation at which the sciences<lb break="yes"/>have progressively arrived.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>In thus tracing the duties of those who have pursued the<lb break="yes"/>same career with myself, and whose example has often roused<lb break="yes"/>my ardour under difficulties, I have noticed the source of that<lb break="yes"/>small success which your generous indulgence has deigned to<lb break="yes"/>honour by public suffrage.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Having happily terminated a distant voyage, undertaken at<lb break="yes"/>the command of a great monarch, and having been assisted by<lb break="yes"/>the talents of two philosophers whose labours Europe appre-<lb break="no"/>ciates, MM. Ehrenberg and Rose, I might confine myself at<lb break="yes"/>present to lay before you the homage of my warmest gratitude,<lb break="yes"/>&#x2014;I might solicit from him, who, though yet young, has dared<lb break="yes"/>to penetrate into ancient mysteries, (the memorable sources of<lb break="yes"/>the religious and political civilization of Greece,) to lend me<lb break="yes"/>his eloquence, that I might express more worthily the sentiments<lb break="yes"/>with which I am impressed. But I know, Gentlemen, that<lb break="yes"/>eloquence which is not in accordance with the sincerity of the<lb break="yes"/>heart will not be sufficient in this assembly. You have been<lb break="yes"/>entrusted in this vast empire with the great and noble mission<lb break="yes"/>of giving a general impulse to the cultivation of the sciences<lb break="yes"/>and literature, to encourage labours connected with the actual<lb break="yes"/>state of human knowledge, and to stimulate and enlarge the<lb break="yes"/>powers of the mind, in the field of the higher mathematics and<lb break="yes"/>of terrestial physics, and in that of the history of nations illus-<lb break="no"/>trated by the monuments of different ages. Your views have<lb break="yes"/>been directed to the career which is yet to be pursued; and the<lb break="yes"/>tribute of thanks which I now offer you,&#x2014;the only one indeed<lb break="yes"/>worthy of your institution, is the solemn obligation which I<lb break="yes"/>take to continue faithful to the cultivation of science, even to<lb break="yes"/>the last hour of a life already advanced,&#x2014;to explore nature un-<lb break="no"/>
                    <pb n="289" facs="#f0004"/> ceasingly, and to follow in the route which you and your illus-<lb break="no"/>trious predecessors have traced.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>This community of action in the higher studies,&#x2014;the recipro-<lb break="no" />cal aid which the different branches of human knowledge derive<lb break="yes" />from each other,&#x2014;the efforts made simultaneously in the two<lb break="yes"/>continents, and in the vast extent of the ocean, have given a<lb break="yes"/>rapid impulse to the physical sciences, in the same manner, as af-<lb break="no"/>ter the barbarous ages, simultaneous efforts gave an impulse to the<lb break="yes"/>progress of reason. <hi rendition="#i">Happy is the country whose government<lb break="yes"/>yields a noble protection to letters and the fine arts, which not<lb break="yes"/>only delight the imagination of man, but augment also his in-<lb break="no"/>tellectual power, and give energy to his noblest thoughts;&#x2014;<lb break="yes"/>to the physical and mathematical sciences which have such a<lb break="yes" />happy influence on the progress of industry and public prospe-<lb break="no"/>rity;</hi>&#x2014;to the zeal of travellers, who, forced to penetrate into<lb break="yes"/>unknown regions, or to examine the riches of the soil, or to ob-<lb break="no"/>tain a correct knowledge of its surface. To recount at first a<lb break="yes"/>small part of what has been done in the year which is about to<lb break="yes"/>close, is to render to the Sovereign a tribute which, by its very<lb break="yes"/>simplicity, must be agreeable to him.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>While in the Oural, the Altai, and the Caspian Sea, the<lb break="yes"/>efforts of MM. Rose, Ehrenberg, and myself, were directed to<lb break="yes"/>the geognostic constitution of the soil, the relations between its<lb break="yes" />elevations and depressions indicated by the barometer; the va-<lb break="no" />riations of terrestrial magnetism in different latitudes (particu-<lb break="no"/>larly the increase of the inclination, and of the intensity of the<lb break="yes"/>magnetic forces;) the interior temperature of the globe; the<lb break="yes"/>state of humidity of the atmosphere by means of a <hi rendition="#i">psychrome-<lb break="no"/>trical</hi> instrument which had never before been employed in a<lb break="yes"/>distant voyage; the astronomical position of places; the geo-<lb break="no"/>graphical distribution of vegetables, and of several groupes of<lb break="yes"/>the animal kingdom hitherto little studied&#x2014;of the philosophers<lb break="yes"/>and intrepid travellers who smiled at the dangers of the snowy<lb break="yes"/>summits of Elborouz and Ararat.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>I congratulate myself in seeing safely returned into the bosom<lb break="yes"/>of the Academy, him from whom we have derived the most<lb break="yes"/>valuable notions on the horary variations of the magnetic<lb break="yes"/>needle, and to whom the sciences owe (independent of his inge-<lb break="no"/>nious and delicate researches on crystallography,) the discovery<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="290" facs="#f0005"/> of the influence of temperature on the intensity of the electro-<lb break="no"/>magnetic forces. M. Kupffer has lately returned from the Alps<lb break="yes"/>of Caucasus, where, after the long migrations of the human spe-<lb break="no"/>cies in the great shipwreck of nations and of languages, so many<lb break="yes"/>different races have taken refuge. With the name of this travel-<lb break="no"/>ler is associated the labours of a philosopher who has struggled<lb break="yes"/>with a noble perseverance on the flanks of Ararat, (considered<lb break="yes"/>as the classical soil of the earliest and most venerable recollec-<lb break="no"/>tions of history,)&#x2014;against obstacles which were opposed to him,<lb break="yes" />both by the depth and the softness of eternal snow. I am al-<lb break="no" />most ashamed to wound the modesty of a father in adding, that<lb break="yes" />M. Parrot, the traveller of Ararat, sustains in the sciences the<lb break="yes"/>lustre of hereditary celebrity.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>In the more eastern regions of an empire, for ever illustri-<lb break="no"/>ous by the labours of my countryman Pallas (pardon me, Gen-<lb break="no"/>tlemen, for claiming for Prussia a part of that glory which is<lb break="yes" />sufficient to distinguish two nations at once,) in the mountains<lb break="yes"/>of the Oural and of Kolyvan, we have followed the more recent<lb break="yes"/>routes of MM. Ledebour, Meyer and Bunge, and MM. Hoff-<lb break="no"/>mann and Helmersson. The fine and numerous Flora of Altai<lb break="yes"/>has already enriched the botanical establishment of this capi-<lb break="no"/>tal, which has risen almost as by enchantment, through the<lb break="yes"/>zeal of its directors, to the rank of the first botanical gardens of<lb break="yes"/>Europe. The learned world expects with impatience the pub-<lb break="no"/>lication of the Flora of Altai, of which Dr Bunge himself was<lb break="yes"/>able, in the vicinity of Zmeinogorsk, to show to my friend, M.<lb break="yes"/>Ehrenberg, some interesting productions. This was, without<lb break="yes"/>doubt, the first time that a traveller in Abyssinia, in Dongola,<lb break="yes"/>Sinai, and Palestine, had climbed the mountains of Riddersky,<lb break="yes"/>covered with perpetual snows.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The geognostic description of the southern part of the Oural<lb break="yes"/>was entrusted to two young philosophers, MM. Hoffmann and<lb break="yes" />Helmersson, one of whom had first made known the volcanoes<lb break="yes"/>of the South Sea. This selection was due to an enlightened<lb break="yes" />minister,&#x2014;a friend of science and of its cultivation,&#x2014;M. Le<lb break="yes"/>Comte de Cancrin, whose affectionate care and provident acti-<lb break="no"/>vity will never be forgotten by my colleagues and myself. MM.<lb break="yes"/>Helmersson and Hoffmann, pupils of the celebrated school of<lb break="yes"/>Dorpat, have successfully studied, during two years, the diffe-<lb break="no"/>
                    <pb n="291" facs="#f0006"/> rent branches of the Oural mountains,&#x2014;from the great Taganai<lb break="yes"/>and the granites of Iremel, to beyond the plateau of Gouber-<lb break="no"/>linsk, which is connected farther south with the mountains of<lb break="yes"/>Mougodjares; and to Oust-Ourt, between Lake Aral and the<lb break="yes"/>Caspian Sea. Even there the rigour of winter did not prevent<lb break="yes"/>M. Lemm from making the first astronomical observations in<lb break="yes"/>this arid and uninhabited country. We enjoyed the great<lb break="yes"/>pleasure of being accompanied for nearly a month by MM.<lb break="yes"/>Hoffmann and Helmersson, and it was they who first showed us<lb break="yes"/>near Grasnuschinskaia a formation of volcanic amygdaloid, the<lb break="yes"/>only one which has been yet found in the long Ouralian chain<lb break="yes"/>which separates Europe from Asia,&#x2014;which presents on its east-<lb break="no"/>ern declivity the most abundant eruptions of metals,&#x2014;and<lb break="yes"/>which contains, either in veins or in the detritus, <hi rendition="#i">gold, platina,<lb break="yes"/>the osmiuret of Iridium, the diamond</hi>, (see this Number, p. 261)<lb break="yes" />discovered by Count Polier in the alluvium to the west of the<lb break="yes" />high mountains of Catschcanar, <hi rendition="#i">zircon, sapphire, amethyst,<lb break="yes"/>ruby, topaz, beryl, garnet, anatase</hi>, discovered by M.

                    <hi rendition="#i">ceylanite</hi>, and other valuable substances found in India and the<lb break="yes"/>Brazils.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>I might extend the list of the important labours of the pre-<lb break="no"/>sent year of his Majesty&#x2019;s reign, by mentioning the trigonome-<lb break="no" />trical operations of the west, which, by the united labours of<lb break="yes" />MM. General Schubert and Tenner, and of the great astro-<lb break="no"/>nomer of Dorpat, M. Struve, have made known on a great<lb break="yes"/>scale the figure of the earth;&#x2014;the geological constitution of<lb break="yes"/>Lake Baikal illustrated by M. Hess;&#x2014;the magnetic expedi-<lb break="no"/>tion of MM. Hansteen, Erman and Dowe, justly celebrated<lb break="yes"/>over all Europe, and the most extensive and the boldest that<lb break="yes"/>was ever undertaken by land, (from Berlin and Christiania to<lb break="yes"/>Kamtchatka, where it joined the great labours of Captains<lb break="yes"/>Wrangell and Anjou);&#x2014;and, finally, the circumnavigation of<lb break="yes"/>the globe, which Captain Luetke has executed by order of<lb break="yes"/>the Sovereign,&#x2014;a voyage abounding in fine astronomical, bota-<lb break="no" />nical, physical, and anatomical results, with the co-operation of<lb break="yes"/>three excellent naturalists, Dr Mertens, Baron Kittliz, and M.<lb break="yes"/>Postels.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>I have ventured to notice this community of efforts by which<lb break="yes" />several parts of the empire have been explored, by carrying<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="292" facs="#f0007"/> into them the aid of modern knowledge, new instruments, new<lb break="yes"/>methods, and views founded on the analogy of facts already<lb break="yes"/>known. It is also by a community of interests, that, launched<lb break="yes"/>once more into the career of travels, I have thought it right to<lb break="yes"/>adorn my discourse with names which are dear to science. After<lb break="yes"/>having admired the riches of the mineral kingdom and the won-<lb break="no"/>ders of physical nature, we love to celebrate (and it is an agree-<lb break="no"/>able duty in a foreign land, and in the midst of a listening as-<lb break="no"/>sembly,) the intellectual riches of a nation, the labours of men<lb break="yes"/>useful and disinterested in their devotion to the sciences, who<lb break="yes"/>either travel through their country, or in solitude prepare, by<lb break="yes"/>calculation and experiments, the discoveries of future generations.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>If, as we have proved by recent examples, the vast extent of<lb break="yes"/>the Russian empire, which exceeds that of the visible part of<lb break="yes"/>the moon, requires the concurrence of a great number of observ-<lb break="no"/>ers, this same extent presents also advantages of another kind<lb break="yes"/>which have been long known to you, Gentlemen, but which, in<lb break="yes"/>relation to the actual desiderata of terrestrial physics, do not<lb break="yes"/>appear to have been generally enough appreciated. I will not<lb break="yes"/>speak of that immense scale on which, from Livonia and Fin-<lb break="no"/>land to the South Sea which washes Eastern Asia and Russian<lb break="yes"/>America, we may study, without going out of the empire, the<lb break="yes"/>stratification and formation of rocks of all ages,&#x2014;the spoils of<lb break="yes"/>marine animals which the ancient revolutions of our planet have<lb break="yes" />engulphed in the bosom of the earth,&#x2014;the gigantic bones of<lb break="yes"/>terrestrial quadrupeds whose congeners are lost, or live only in<lb break="yes"/>the tropical regions. I will not fix the attention of this assem-<lb break="no"/>bly on the aid which the geography of plants and animals (a<lb break="yes"/>science scarcely yet blocked out,) will some day derive from a<lb break="yes"/>more profound and specific knowledge of the climateric distri-<lb break="no"/>bution of organized beings, from the happy regions of the Cher-<lb break="no"/>sonesus and of Mingrelia,&#x2014;from the frontiers of Persia and<lb break="yes"/>Asia Minor to the sad shores of the Frozen Sea. I shall con-<lb break="no"/>fine myself at present to those variable phenomena whose regu-<lb break="no"/>lar periodicity, confirmed by the rigorous accuracy of astrono-<lb break="no"/>mical observations, will conduct directly to the discovery of the<lb break="yes"/>great laws of nature.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>If they had possessed in the school of Alexandria, and at the<lb break="yes" />brilliant epoch of the Arabs, (the first masters of the art of ob-<lb break="no"/>
                    <pb n="293" facs="#f0008"/> serving and interrogating nature by experiment,) the instru-<lb break="no"/>ments which belonged to the great age of Galileo, of Huy-<lb break="no"/>ghens, and of Fermat, we should have now known, by compa-<lb break="no"/>rative observations, if the height of the atmosphere, the quan-<lb break="no"/>tity of water which it contains and precipitates, and the mean<lb break="yes"/>temperature of places have diminished since those times. We<lb break="yes"/>should have known the secular changes of the electro-magnetic<lb break="yes"/>charge of our planet, and the modifications which may have<lb break="yes"/>taken place, either from an increase of radiation, or from inter-<lb break="no"/>nal volcanic changes, in the temperature of the different strata<lb break="yes"/>of the globe, which increases with the depth. We might have<lb break="yes"/>known, in short, the variations in the level of the ocean, the<lb break="yes"/>partial perturbations which the barometrical pressure produces<lb break="yes"/>in the equilibrium of its waters, and the relative frequency of<lb break="yes"/>certain winds, depending on the form and condition of the sur-<lb break="no"/>face of continents. M. Ostrogradsky would have submitted<lb break="yes"/>to profound calculations these data, accumulated for centu-<lb break="no"/>ries, as he has recently resolved with success one of the most<lb break="yes"/>difficult problems in the propagation of waves.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Unfortunately, in the physical sciences the civilization of<lb break="yes" />Europe is not of remote date. We are, as the priests of Sais<lb break="yes" />said of the Hellenes, a new people. The almost simultaneous<lb break="yes" />invention of those organs which bring us nearer to the material<lb break="yes" />world, as the telescope,&#x2014;the thermometer,&#x2014;the barometer,&#x2014;<lb break="yes"/>the pendulum, and that other instrument, the most general and<lb break="yes"/>powerful of all,&#x2014;the infinitesimal calculus, are scarcely older<lb break="yes"/>than thirty lustra. In this conflict of the forces of nature, a<lb break="yes"/>conflict which does not destroy stability, the periodical varia-<lb break="no"/>tions do not seem to go beyond certain limits: They cause the<lb break="yes"/>whole system to oscillate (at least in the present state of things,<lb break="yes"/>since the great convulsions which have buried so many genera-<lb break="no"/>tions of plants and animals,) round a mean state of equilibrium.<lb break="yes"/>But the value of the periodic change is determined with a de-<lb break="no"/>gree of precision proportional to the interval which has elapsed<lb break="yes"/>between the extreme observations.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>It is to scientific bodies which are renewed without interrup-<lb break="no" />tion; it is to academies,&#x2014;to universities,&#x2014;to different learned<lb break="yes"/>societies in Europe, in the two Americas, at the southern ex-<lb break="no"/>tremity of Africa, in India, and in that Australasia lately so<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="294" facs="#f0009"/> uncivilized, and where there has already risen a temple of Ura-<lb break="no"/>nia, that we must look for regular observations, to measure, and<lb break="yes"/>to watch, as it were, whatever is variable in the economy of na-<lb break="no"/>ture.<note place="foot" n="*">This Observatory was the work of our eminent countryman Sir Tho-<lb break="no"/>mas Brisbane, whose fate it seems to be to have his labours every where<lb break="yes" />praised, and even the observations which he established, published, with-<lb break="no"/>out the mention of his name!&#x2014;<hi rendition="#k">Ed</hi>.
                    </note> The illustrious author of the <hi rendition="#i">Mecanique Celeste</hi> has of-<lb break="no"/>ten expressed verbally the same thought in the bosom of the<lb break="yes"/>Institute, where I had the happiness of sitting with him during<lb break="yes"/>eighteen years.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The western nations have carried into different parts of the<lb break="yes" />world these forms of civilization,&#x2014;this developement of human<lb break="yes"/>knowledge, whose origin remounts to the epoch of the intellec-<lb break="no"/>tual greatness of the Greeks, and to the gentle influence of<lb break="yes"/>Christianity. Divided by language and manners, by political<lb break="yes"/>and religious institutions, enlightened nations form in our day<lb break="yes"/>(and it is one of the happiest results of modern civilization) but<lb break="yes"/>a single family, when they are occupied with the great inte-<lb break="no"/>rests of science, of letters, and of the arts,&#x2014;of whatever, hav-<lb break="no"/>ing its origin within, raises man above the vulgar wants of so-<lb break="no"/>ciety.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>In this noble community of interest and action, most of the<lb break="yes" />important problems relating to terrestrial physics which I have<lb break="yes" />above noticed, may doubtless become the object of simultaneous<lb break="yes" />researches; but the immense extent of the Russian empire in<lb break="yes" />Europe, Asia, and America, presents peculiar and local advan-<lb break="no" />tages well worthy of one day occupying the attention of this<lb break="yes" />illustrious society. The impulse given from such a height<lb break="yes" />would produce a powerful activity among the philosophers and<lb break="yes" />observers with whom your country is honoured. I venture to<lb break="yes" />point out at present, and to recommend to your special care,<lb break="yes" />three objects which are not (as was formerly said in a miscon-<lb break="no" />ception of the connection of human knowledge,) purely specula-<lb break="no" />tive, but which closely affect the most material wants of life.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The art of navigation, the study of which, encouraged by the<lb break="yes" />highest suffrage, has assumed (under the direction of a great<lb break="yes" />navigator,) such a fortunate developement in this country,&#x2014;the<lb break="yes"/>art of navigation has required for centuries a precise knowledge<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="295" facs="#f0010"/> of the variations of terrestrial magnetism in the declination and<lb break="yes"/>dip of the needle, and in the intensity of its force; for the de-<lb break="no"/>clination of the needle in different countries, which is more ex-<lb break="no"/>clusively required by sailors, is intimately connected in theory<lb break="yes"/>with the other two elements, the inclination and the intensity as<lb break="yes"/>measured by oscillations. At no preceding epoch has the know-<lb break="no"/>ledge of the variations of terrestrial magnetism made such rapid<lb break="yes"/>progress as within the last thirty years. The angle which the<lb break="yes"/>needle forms with the vertical and with the meridian of a place,<lb break="yes"/>&#x2014;the intensity of the forces which I have had the good for-<lb break="no"/>tune to observe from the equator to the magnetic pole,&#x2014;the<lb break="yes"/>horary variations of the declination,&#x2014;the inclination and the mag-<lb break="no"/>netic intensity often modified by the aurora borealis, earthquakes,<lb break="yes" />and mysterious motions in the interior of the globe,&#x2014;the starts<lb break="yes"/>or non-periodical perturbations of the needle, which, after a long<lb break="yes"/>course of observations, I have distinguished by the name of<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">magnetic storms</hi>, have become in their turn the object of the<lb break="yes"/>most elaborate research. The great discoveries of Oersted,<lb break="yes"/>Arago, Ampere, Seebeck, Morichini, and Mrs Somerville, have<lb break="yes"/>disclosed to us the mutual relations of magnetism with electri-<lb break="no"/>city, heat, and solar light. There are only three metals&#x2014;iron,<lb break="yes"/>nickel, and cobalt, which become loadstones. The astonishing<lb break="yes"/>phenomenon of the magnetism of rotation, which my illustrious<lb break="yes"/>friend, M. Arago first made known, shows us that almost all the<lb break="yes"/>bodies of nature are transiently susceptible of magnetic action.<lb break="yes"/>The Russian empire is the only country which is traversed with<lb break="yes"/>two lines of no declination,&#x2014;that is, in which the needle is di-<lb break="no"/>rected to the poles of the globe. One of these two lines, whose<lb break="yes"/>position and periodical motion of translation from east to west<lb break="yes"/>are the principal elements of a future theory of terrestrial mag-<lb break="no"/>netism, passes, according to the latest researches of MM. Han-<lb break="no"/>steen and Erman, between Mourom and Nijni-Novgorod; the<lb break="yes"/>second some degrees to the east of Irkoutsk, between Parchin-<lb break="no"/>skaia and Iarbinsk. We do not yet know their prolongation to<lb break="yes"/>the north, or the rapidity of their motion to the west. Terres-<lb break="no"/>trial physics requires the complete trace of the two lines of no<lb break="yes"/>declination at equidistant epochs, every ten years for example,<lb break="yes"/>&#x2014;the precise absolute variations of inclination and intensity in<lb break="yes"/>all the points where MM. Hansteen, Erman, and I, have ob-<lb break="no"/>
                    <pb n="296" facs="#f0011"/> served&#x2014;in Europe, between St Petersburg, Kasan, and Astra-<lb break="no"/>kan,&#x2014;in Northern Asia between Iekaterinebourg, Miask, Oust-<lb break="no"/>Kamenogorsk, Obdorsk, and Jakoutsk. These results cannot be<lb break="yes"/>obtained by strangers who traverse the country in one direc-<lb break="no"/>tion, and at one time. It is necessary to establish a system of<lb break="yes"/>observations well arranged, continued during a long space of<lb break="yes"/>time, and confided to philosophers established in the country.<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">St Petersburg, Moscow</hi>, and <hi rendition="#i" >Kasan</hi>, are fortunately placed<lb break="yes"/>very near the first line of no declination which traverses Euro-<lb break="no"/>pean Russia. Kiachta and Verkhné-Oudinsk offer advantages<lb break="yes"/>for the second, viz. that of Siberia. When we reflect on the<lb break="yes"/>comparative precision of observations made by sea and land with<lb break="yes"/>the aid of the instruments of Borda, of Bessel, and of Gambey,<lb break="yes"/>we may be readily convinced, that Russia, by its position, may<lb break="yes"/>in the space of twenty years cause the most gigantic progress<lb break="yes"/>to be made in the theory of magnetism. In entering upon<lb break="yes"/>these considerations, I am, so to speak, only the interpreter of<lb break="yes"/>your wishes, Gentlemen. The eagerness which which you have<lb break="yes"/>received the request which I addressed to you seven months<lb break="yes"/>ago, relative to the corresponding observations of the horary va-<lb break="no"/>riations made at Paris, at Berlin, in a mine at Freyberg, and<lb break="yes"/>at Kasan by the learned and laborious astronomer M. Simonoff,<lb break="yes"/>has proved that the Imperial Academy will ably second the<lb break="yes"/>other academies of Europe in the thorny but useful research of<lb break="yes"/>the periodicity of the magnetic phenomena.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>If the solution of the problem which I have mentioned is<lb break="yes"/>equally important for the physical history of our planet and the<lb break="yes" />progress of the art of navigation, the <hi rendition="#i">second</hi> object to which I<lb break="yes"/>wish to draw your attention, Gentlemen, and for which the ex-<lb break="no"/>tent of the empire presents immense advantages, is more closely<lb break="yes"/>connected with general wants,&#x2014;with the choice of cultivation,<lb break="yes"/>&#x2014;the study of the configuration of the soil,&#x2014;and the exact<lb break="yes"/>knowledge of the humidity of the air, which obviously decreases<lb break="yes"/>with the destruction of forests and the diminution of the waters<lb break="yes"/>of lakes and rivers. The first and the noblest object of the<lb break="yes"/>sciences lies no doubt in themselves, in the enlargement of the<lb break="yes"/>sphere of our ideas, and of the intellectual energy of man. It<lb break="yes"/>is not in an academy like yours, and under the monarch who<lb break="yes"/>rules the destiny of the empire, that the investigation of great<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="297" facs="#f0012"/> physical truths requires the support of a material and external<lb break="yes"/>interest&#x2014;of an immediate application to the wants of social life;<lb break="yes"/>but when the sciences, without deviating from their noble and<lb break="yes"/>primitive object, can boast of their indirect influence upon agri-<lb break="no"/>culture and the arts of industry, (too exclusively called the use-<lb break="no"/>ful arts,) it is the duty of the natural philosopher to bring for-<lb break="no"/>ward the relations which exist between the study and the increase<lb break="yes"/>of territorial wealth.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>A country which extends over more than 135 degrees of lon-<lb break="no"/>gitude, from the happy zone of the olive tree to the climates<lb break="yes"/>where the soil is covered only with lichens, may advance more<lb break="yes"/>than any other the study of the atmosphere, the knowledge of<lb break="yes"/>mean annual temperatures, and what is more important for the<lb break="yes"/>cycle of vegetation, that of the distribution of the annual heat<lb break="yes"/>over the different seasons. Add to these data, in order to ob-<lb break="no"/>tain a group of facts intimately connected with one another, the<lb break="yes" />variable pressure of the air, and the relation of this pressure<lb break="yes" />with the prevailing winds and the temperature,&#x2014;the extent of the<lb break="yes"/>horary variations of the barometer, (variations which, under the<lb break="yes"/>tropics, transform a tube filled with mercury into a kind of<lb break="yes"/>clock with the most undisturbed movements)&#x2014;the hygrometric<lb break="yes"/>state of the air, and the annual quantity of rain, so important<lb break="yes"/>to be known for the purposes of agriculture. When the varied<lb break="yes"/>inflexion of the isothermal lines shall be traced by accurate va-<lb break="no"/>riations, and continued at least during five years in European<lb break="yes"/>Russia and Siberia;&#x2014;when they shall be prolonged to the<lb break="yes"/>Western Coasts of America, where that excellent navigator,<lb break="yes"/>Captain Wrangell, will soon reside, the science of the distribu-<lb break="no"/>tion of heat at the surface of the globe, and in the strata ac-<lb break="no"/>cessible to our researches, will rest on solid foundations.</p>

                <p>The government of the United States of North America,<lb break="yes"/>deeply interested in the progress of population, and of the va-<lb break="no"/>ried culture of useful plants, has felt, for a long time, the ad-<lb break="no" />vantages presented by the extent of its territory, from the At-<lb break="no" />lantic to the Rocky mountains, from Louisiana and Florida,<lb break="yes" />where sugar is cultivated, to the lakes of Canada. Meteorolo-<lb break="no" />gical instruments, compared with one another, have been dis-<lb break="no" />tributed over a great number of points, the selection of which<lb break="yes" />has been the subject of discussion, and the annual results, re-<lb break="no"/>
                    <pb n="298" facs="#f0013"/> duced to a small number of figures are published by a central<lb break="yes"/>committee who watch over the uniformity of the observations and<lb break="yes"/>the calculations.&#x2014;(See this <hi rendition="#i">Journal</hi>, No. xvi. and No. ii. New<lb break="yes" />Series, p. 249.) I have already mentioned, in a memoir where<lb break="yes"/>I have discussed the general causes on which the difference of<lb break="yes" />climates in the same latitude depends, upon what a great scale<lb break="yes" />this fine example of the United States may be followed in the<lb break="yes" />Russian empire.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>We are fortunately far from the epoch when philosophers<lb break="yes"/>believed that they knew the climate of a place when they knew<lb break="yes"/>the highest and the lowest temperature during the year. An<lb break="yes"/>uniform method, founded on the choice of hours, and on a level<lb break="yes"/>with the knowledge recently acquired respecting the true means<lb break="yes"/>of the day, the month, and the year, will replace ancient and<lb break="yes"/>defective methods. By this labour several prejudices on the<lb break="yes"/>choice of culture, on the possibility of planting the vine, the<lb break="yes"/>mulberry tree, fruit trees, the chesnut or the oak, will disappear<lb break="yes"/>in certain provinces of the empire. To extend it to the most<lb break="yes" />distant parts we may reckon upon the enlightened co-operation<lb break="yes" />of many of the young and well educated officers of the Corps<lb break="yes" />of Mines,&#x2014;upon that of medical men, animated with a zeal for<lb break="yes"/>the physical sciences,&#x2014;and the pupils of that excellent institu-<lb break="no"/>tion the School of Roads and Canals, in which the higher ma-<lb break="no"/>thematical studies create an instinctive tact for order and pre-<lb break="no"/>cision.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Besides these two objects of research which we have examin-<lb break="no"/>ed in reference to the extent of the empire, (terrestrial magne-<lb break="no"/>tism and the study of the atmosphere which leads at the same<lb break="yes"/>time by the aid of barometrical measurement to a perfect<lb break="yes"/>knowledge of the configuration of the ground,) I will place<lb break="yes"/>a third kind of investigation of a more local interest, though<lb break="yes"/>connected with the great question of physical geography.<lb break="yes"/>A considerable part of the surface of the globe round the Cas-<lb break="no"/>pian Sea is found inferior in level to that of the Black Sea and<lb break="yes"/>the Baltic. This depression, which has been suspected to exist<lb break="yes"/>for more than a century, and measured by the laborious opera-<lb break="no"/>tions of MM. Parrot and Engelhardt, may be ranked among<lb break="yes"/>the most interesting phenomena of geognosy. The exact de-<lb break="no"/>termination of the mean annual barometric height of the town<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="299" facs="#f0014"/> of Orenburg due to MM. Hoffmann and Helmersson, a level-<lb break="no"/>ling by station made by the same observers with the aid of a<lb break="yes"/>barometer, from Orenburg to Gourief, the east part of the<lb break="yes"/>Caspian Sea; corresponding measures taken during several<lb break="yes"/>months in these two places; and lastly, observations which we<lb break="yes"/>have recently made at Astrakhan and at the embouchure of the<lb break="yes"/>Volga, corresponding at the same time to Sarepta, Orenburg,<lb break="yes"/>Kasan, and Moscow, will serve (when all the data are united<lb break="yes"/>and rigorously calculated) to verify the absolute height of this<lb break="yes"/>interior basin.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>On the north side of the Caspian every thing at present ap-<lb break="no"/>pears to indicate a progressive depression of the level of its<lb break="yes"/>waters; but without placing too much trust in the relation of<lb break="yes"/>Hanway (an old English traveller, otherwise very estimable)<lb break="yes"/>respecting its periodical increase and decrease, we cannot deny<lb break="yes"/>the encroachments of the Caspian on the side of the ancient<lb break="yes"/>town of Terek, and to the south of the embouchure of the Cyrus,<lb break="yes"/>where scattered trunks of trees (the remains of a forest) are<lb break="yes"/>found constantly inundated. The small island of Pogorelaia<lb break="yes"/>Plita, on the contrary, seems to increase and rise progressively<lb break="yes"/>above the waves which covered it a few years ago, before the<lb break="yes"/>jet of flames which navigators perceived at a distance.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>In order to solve completely the great problems relative to<lb break="yes"/>the depression, perhaps variable, of the level of the sea and<lb break="yes"/>that of the continental basin of the Caspian, it would be de-<lb break="no"/>sirable to trace in the interior of the land round this basin, in<lb break="yes"/>the plains of Sarepta, Ouralsk, and Orenburg a <hi rendition="#i">ligne de<lb break="yes"/>sonde</hi>, by uniting the points which are exactly on the level of<lb break="yes"/>the Baltic and the Black Sea, which will be compared with<lb break="yes"/>marks placed on the coast in the whole circuit of the Caspian,<lb break="yes"/>(like the marks placed almost a century ago on the Swedish<lb break="yes"/>shores by the Academy of Stockholm) if there is a general or<lb break="yes"/>partial, a continued or a periodical depression of its waters, or<lb break="yes"/>if rather (as has been conjectured for the whole of Scandina-<lb break="no"/>via, by that great geognost, M. Lepold de Buch,) a part of the<lb break="yes"/>neighbouring continent is raised or depressed by volcanic causes<lb break="yes"/>acting at immense depths in the interior of the globe.

                <p>In these general views, which I submit to your conside-<lb break="no"/>ration, Gentlemen, I have endeavoured to point out some of<lb break="yes"/>the advantages which the physical history of the globe may<lb break="yes"/>derive from the position and extent of this empire. I have ex-<lb break="no"/>plained the ideas which were deeply impressed upon me by a<lb break="yes"/>sight of the regions which I have visited. It appeared to me<lb break="yes"/>more suitable to render public honours to those, who, under<lb break="yes"/>the auspices of government, have pursued the same career as<lb break="yes"/>myself, and to draw attention to what remains to be done for<lb break="yes"/>the progress of science and the glory of your country, than to<lb break="yes"/>speak of my own efforts, and to condense into a narrow space the<lb break="yes"/>results of observations which require still to be compared with the<lb break="yes"/>great mass of partial data which we have collected. I have<lb break="yes"/>mentioned in this discourse the extent of the countries which<lb break="yes"/>separate the line of no variation to the east of Lake Baikal,<lb break="yes"/>from the basin of the Caspian;&#x2014;of the valleys of Cyrus and<lb break="yes"/>the frozen summits of Ararat. At these names we involuntari-<lb break="no"/>ly revert to that recent struggle, in which the moderation of the<lb break="yes"/>conqueror has increased the glory of his arms, which has open-<lb break="no"/>ed new roads to commerce, and completed the deliverance of<lb break="yes"/>that Greece, which has long been the abandoned cradle of the<lb break="yes"/>civilization of our ancestors. But it is not within these peace-<lb break="no"/>ful walls that I should celebrate the glory of arms. The august<lb break="yes"/>monarch who has deigned to invite me into this country and to<lb break="yes"/>smile upon my labours, appears to me as the genius of peace.<lb break="yes"/>Encouraging, by his example, all that is true, great, and ge-<lb break="no"/>nerous; he has been pleased, from the dawn of his reign, to<lb break="yes"/>protect the study of the sciences which strengthen reason, and<lb break="yes"/>of letters and the arts, which adorn the character of nations.</p>
