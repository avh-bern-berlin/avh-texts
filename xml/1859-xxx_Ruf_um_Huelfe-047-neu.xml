    <p><hi rendition="#k">The Veteran Humboldt.</hi>&#x2014;Baron de Humboldt<lb/>
        has addressed the following note to the Berlin journals:&#x2014;<lb/>
        &#x201C;Overwhelmed by the number of letters sent me, and which<lb/>
        are increasing every day, amounting to from 1,600 to 2,000<lb/>
        per annum; many, too, being on the most futile subjects&#x2014;<lb/>
        such as demands for my autograph, and offers to cure me of<lb/>
        all diseases&#x2014;I once more make a public appeal to the persons<lb/>
        who wish me well, and request them not to occupy themselves<lb/>
        so much with what concerns me, in order that, with the dimi-<lb/>
        nution of strength, physical and intellectual, which I<lb/>
        experience, I may be allowed a little leisure for study and<lb/>
        composition. I trust that this step, to which I have recourse<lb/>
        with reluctance, will not be interpreted unkindly.&#x201D;</p><lb/></body><back></back>
