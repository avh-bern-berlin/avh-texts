<div n="1"><head>THE ROCK OF THE GUAHIBA WOMAN.</head><lb/><p><hi rendition="#c"><hi rendition="#i">(From the ne@y published volume of Humboldt&#x2019;s Travels.)</hi></hi></p><lb/><p>Before we reached the junction of the Atabapo<lb/>with the Rio Temi, a grunitic hummock, that rises<lb/>on the western bank, near the mouth of the Guasa-<lb/>cavi, fixed our attention: it is called the Rock of<lb/>the Guahiba woman, or the Rock of the Mother,<lb/><hi rendition="#i">Piedra de la Madre.</hi> We inquired the cause of so<lb/>singular a denomination. Father Zea could not sa-<lb/>tisfy our curiosity; but some weeks after, another<lb/>missionary, one of the predecessors of this ecclesias-<lb/>tic, whom we found settled at San Fernando as pre-<lb/>sident of the missions, related to us an event, which<lb/>I recorded in my Journal, and which excited in our<lb/>minds the most painful feelings. If, in these solitary<lb/>scenes, man scarcely leaves behind him any trace of<lb/>his existence, it is doubly humiliating for a European<lb/>to see perpetuated by the name of a rock, by one<lb/>of those imperishable monuments of nature, the re-<lb/>membrance of the moral degradation of our species,<lb/>and the contrast between the virtue of a savage, and<lb/>the barbarism of civilized man!</p><lb/><p>In 1797 the missionary of San Fernando had<lb/>led his Indians to the banks of the Rio Guaviare,<lb/>on one of those hostile incursions, which are pro-<lb/>hibited alike by religion and the Spanish laws.&#x2014;<lb/>They found in an Italian hut, a Guahiba mother<lb/>with three children, two of whom were still in-<lb/>fants. They were occupied in preparing the<lb/>flour of Cassava. Resistance was impossible; the<lb/>father was gone to fish, and the mother tried in<lb/>vain to flee with her children. Scarcely had she<lb/>reached the Savannah, when she was seized by the<lb/>Indians of the mission, who go to <hi rendition="#i">hunt men,</hi> like<lb/>the whites and the negroes in Africa. The mo-<lb/>ther and her children were bound, and dragged<lb/>to the bank of the river. The monk, seated in<lb/>his boat, waited the issue of an expedition, of<lb/>which he partook not the danger. Had the mo-<lb/>ther made too violent a resistance, the Indians<lb/>would have killed her, for every thing is permit-<lb/>ted when they go in the conquest of souls <hi rendition="#i">(a la<lb/>conquista espiritual,)</hi> and it is children in particu-<lb/>lar they seek to capture, in order to treat them,<lb/>in the mission, as <hi rendition="#i">poitos,</hi> or slaves of the Chris-<lb/>tians. The prisoners were carried to San Fer-<lb/>nando in the hope, that the mother would be<lb/>unable to find her way back to her home, by<lb/>land. Far from those children who had accom-<lb/>panied their father on the day in which she had<lb/>been carried off, this unhappy woman showed<lb/>signs of the deepest despair. She attempted to<lb/>take back to her family the children who had<lb/>been snatched away by the missionary, and fled<lb/>with them repeatedly from the village of San<lb/>Fernando, but the Indians never failed to seize<lb/>her anew; and the missionary, after having caused<lb/>her to be mercilessly beaten, took the cruel re-<lb/>solution of separating the mother from the two<lb/>children, who had been carried off with her. She<lb/>was conveyed alone towards the missions of Rio<lb/>Negro, going up the Atabapo. Slightly bound,<lb/>she was seated at the bow of the boat, ignorant<lb/>of the fate that awaited her; but she judged, by<lb/>the direction of the sun, that she was removed<lb/>farther and farther from her hut and her native<lb/>country. She succeeded in breaking her bonds,<lb/>threw herself into the water, and swam to the<lb/>left bank of the Atabapo. The current catried<lb/>her to a shelf of rock, which bears her name to<lb/>this day. She landed and took shelter in the<lb/>woods, but the president of the missions ordered<lb/>the Indians to row to the shore, and follow the<lb/>traces of the Guahiba. In the evening she was<lb/>brought back.&#x2014;Stretched upon the rock <hi rendition="#i">(la<lb/>Piedra de la Madre)</hi> a cruel punishment was in-<lb/>flicted on her with those straps of manatee lea-<lb/>ther, which serve for whips in that country, and<lb/>with which the alcades are always furnished.&#x2014;<lb/>This unhappy woman, her hands tied behind her<lb/><pb facs="#f0002" />
back with strong stalks of <hi rendition="#i">mavacure,</hi> was then<lb/>dragged to the mission of Javila.</p><lb/><p>She was thrown into one of the caravanseras that<lb/>are called <hi rendition="#i">Casa del Rey.</hi> It was the rainy sea-<lb/>son, and the night was profoundly dark. Forests,<lb/>till then believed to be impenetrable, separated the<lb/>mission of Javita from that of San Fernando, which<lb/>was twenty-five leagues distant in a straight line.&#x2014;<lb/>No other part is known than that of the rivers; no<lb/>man ever attempted to go by land from @ village<lb/>to another, were they only a few leagues apart.&#x2014;<lb/>But such di@ficulties do not stop a @<lb/>separated from her children. Her @<lb/>San Fernando de Atabapo; she @<lb/>again, she must execute her project of delivering<lb/>them from the hands of Christians of bringing them<lb/>back to their father on the banks of the Guaviare.<lb/>The Guahibi was carelessly guarded in the @-<lb/>vansera. Her arms being wounded, the Indians of<lb/>Javi@a had loosened her bonds, unknown to the<lb/>missionary and the alcades. She succeeded by the<lb/>help of her reeth in breaking them entirely; @-<lb/>appeared during the night: and at the fourth rising<lb/>sun was seen at the mission of San Fernando, @-<lb/>vering around the hut where her children were con-<lb/>fined. &#x201C;What that woman performed,&#x201D; added the<lb/>missionary who gave us this sad narrative, &#x201C;the<lb/>mast ro@ast Indian would not have ventured to<lb/>undertake. She traversed the words at the season<lb/>when the sky is cons@antly covered with clouds, and<lb/>the sun during whole days appears but for a few<lb/>minutes. Did the course of the waters direct her<lb/>way? The inundations of the rivers forced her to<lb/>go for from the banks of the main streum, through<lb/>the midst of woods where the movement of the<lb/>waters is almost imperceptible. How @<lb/>she have been stopped by the thorny lianas, that<lb/>form a network around the trunks they entwine?<lb/>How often must she have swam @ss the @<lb/>that run into the Atabapo! This unfortunate<lb/>woman was asked how she had sustained herself<lb/>during the four days! She said, that exhausted<lb/>with fatigue, she could find no other nourishment<lb/>than those great black ants called <hi rendition="#i">vachacos,</hi> which<lb/>climb the trees in long bands, to suspend on them<lb/>their resinous nests.&#x201D; We pressed the missionary<lb/>to tell us, whether the Guahiba had peacefully en-<lb/>joyed the happiness of remaining with her children;<lb/>and if any repentance had followed this excess of<lb/>cruelty. He would not satisfy our curiosity; but<lb/>at our return from the Rio Negro we learnt, that<lb/>the Indian mother was not allowed time to cure her<lb/>wounds, but was again separated from her children,<lb/>and sent to one of the missions o@ the Upper O@o-<lb/>ko. There she died, refusing all kind of nourish-<lb/>ment, as the savages do in great calamities.</p><lb/><p>Such is the remembrance annexed to this fatal<lb/>rock, to <hi rendition="#i">Piedra de la Madre.</hi></p></div><lb/></body><back></back>
