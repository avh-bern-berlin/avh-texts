<p>Baron de Humboldt has addressed the following<lb/>note to the Berlin
                journals:&#x2014;&#x201C;Overwhelmed by the<lb/>number of letters sent me, which are
                increasing<lb/>every day, amounting to from 1,600 to 2,000 per<lb/>annum; many, too,
                being on the most futile sub-<lb/>jects, such as demands for my autograph, and
                offers<lb/>to cure me of all diseases; I once more make a pub-<lb/>lic appeal to the
                persons who wish me well, and re-<lb/>quest them not to occupy themselves so much
                with<lb/>what concerns me, in order that, with the diminution<lb/>of strength,
                physical and intellectual, which I ex-<lb/>perience, I may be allowed a little
                leisure for study<lb/>and composition. I trust that this step, to which I<lb/>have
                recourse with reluctance, will not be interpre-<lb/>ted unkindly.&#x201D;</p><lb/></body><back></back>
