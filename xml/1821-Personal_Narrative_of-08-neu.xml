                    his discourse;<lb/>whence, without further preface, we<lb/>shall now proceed to

                    which<lb/>river M. de Humboldt made his way<lb/>to a height little known to
                    Europeans,<lb/><lb/><cb/>are distinguished by several remarkable<lb/>prejudices,

                    makes<lb/>such cruel ravages, that the natives,<lb/>seized with dismay, burn
                    their huts,<lb/>kill their children, and renounce every<lb/>kind of
                        society.<note place="foot" n="&#8224;">As the Mahas in the plains of the

                        and Lewis.</note> This scourge is al-<lb/>most unknown on the banks of
                    the<lb/>Oroonoko. What depopulates the<lb/>Christian settlements is, the
                    repugnance<lb/>of the Indians for the regulations of the<lb/>missions, the
                    insalubrity of a climate<lb/>at once hot and damp, bad nourish-<lb/>ment, want
                    of care in the diseases of<lb/>children, and the guilty practice of<lb/>mothers
                    of preventing pregnancy by<lb/>the use of deleterious herbs. Among<lb/>the
                    barbarous people of Guyana, as<lb/>well as those of the half-civilized
                    islands<lb/>of the South Sea, young wives will not<lb/>become mothers. If they
                    have chil-<lb/>dren, their offspring are exposed, not<lb/>only to the dangers of
                    savage life, but<lb/>also to the dangers arising from the<lb/>strangest popular

                <p>Amid the prodigality and magnifi-<lb/>cence of nature, such are the moral
                    evils<lb/>which deform the scene; and we are<lb/>often compelled to leave the

                    zone, to vex our<lb/>spirits with similar details. But, the<lb/>able manner in
                    which distant objects<lb/>and remote similitudes are brought to<lb/>bear on
                    almost every subject discussed,<lb/><cb/>is the great charm of this work;
                    and<lb/>we have so vast a quantity of intelli-<lb/>gence combined with so rich a
                    fund of<lb/>amusing anecdote, that the mind never<lb/>tires. It has been
                    alleged, that Mr. H.<lb/>is too prone to this sort of classification,<lb/>and to
                    theories built upon it; but how-<lb/>ever that may be in a
                    philosophical<lb/>point of view, as a popular performance,<lb/>it wonderfully

                    many<lb/>simples, extracted from many objects;<lb/>and, indeed, the sundry
                    contemplation<lb/>of his travels, in which his often rumi-<lb/>nation wraps him
                    in a most humourous<lb/>sadness.&#x201D; He morals on every thing;<lb/>for
                    example:&#x2014;</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The inhabitants of Atures and<lb/>Maypures, whatever the
                    missionaries<lb/>may have asserted in their works, are<lb/>not more struck with
                    deafness by the<lb/>noise of the great cataracts, than the<lb/>catadupes of the
                    Nile. When this<lb/>noise is heard in the plain that sur-<lb/>rounds the
                    mission, at the distance of<lb/>more than a league, you seem to be<lb/>near a
                    coast skirted by reefs and break-<lb/>ers. The noise is three times as loud<lb/>
                    by night as by day, and gives an inex-<lb/>pressible charm to these solitary
                    scenes.<lb/>What can be the cause of this increas-<lb/>ed intensity of sound in
                    a desert, where<lb/>nothing seems to interrupt the silence of<lb/>nature? The
                    velocity of the propaga-<lb/>tion of sound, far from augmenting,<lb/>decreases
                    with the lowering of the tem-<lb/>perature. The intensity diminishes in<lb/>
                    air, agitated by a wind, which is con-<lb/>trary to the direction of the sound;
                    it<lb/>diminishes also by dilatation of the air,<lb/>and is weaker in the higher
                    than in the<lb/>lower regions of the atmosphere, where<lb/>the number of
                    particles of air in motion<lb/>is greater in the same radius. The
                    in-<lb/>tensity is the same in dry air, and in air<lb/>mingled with vapours; but
                    it is feebler<lb/>in carbonic acid gas, than in mixtures of<lb/>azot and oxygen.
                    From these facts,<lb/>which are all we know with any cer-<lb/>tainty, it is
                    difficult to explain a phe-<lb/>nomenon observed near every cascade<lb/>in
                    Europe, and which, long before our<lb/><pb n="411" facs="#f0003"/>
                    <cb/>arrival in the village of Atures, had<lb/>struck the missionary and the
                    Indians.<lb/>The nocturnal temperature of the at-<lb/>mosphere is 3 degrees less
                    than the<lb/>temperature of the day; at the same<lb/>time the apparent humidity
                    augments<lb/>at night, and the mist that covers the<lb/>cataracts becomes
                    thicker. We have<lb/>just seen, that the hygroscopic state of<lb/>the air has no
                    influence on the propaga-<lb/>tion of the sound, and that the cooling<lb/>of the
                    air diminishes its swiftness.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;It may be thought, that, even in<lb/>places not inhabited by man, the
                    hum<lb/>of insects, the song of birds, the rustling<lb/>of leaves agitated by
                    the feeblest winds,<lb/>occasion, during the day, a confused<lb/>noise, which we
                    perceive the less be-<lb/>cause it is uniform, and constantly<lb/>strikes the
                    ear. Now this noise, how-<lb/>ever slightly perceptible it may be, may<lb/>
                    diminish the intensity of a louder, noise;<lb/>and this diminution may cease, if
                    dur-<lb/>ing the calm of the night the song of<lb/>birds, the hum of insects,
                    and the action<lb/>of the wind upon the leaves, be inter-<lb/>rupted. But this
                    reasoning, even ad-<lb/>mitting its justness, can scarcely be ap-<lb/>plied to
                    the forests of the Oroonoko,<lb/>where the air is constantly filled by
                    an<lb/>innumerable quantity of moschettoes,<lb/>where the hum of insects is much
                    loud-<lb/>er by night than by day, and where the<lb/>breeze, if ever it be felt,
                    blows only af-<lb/>ter sunset.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>This hypothesis is well worth further<lb/>investigations; but we must
                    surrender<lb/>it to the scientific journals, and continue<lb/>our more mixed
                    career.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The Indians of Atures,&#x201D; says Mr.<lb/>H., &#x201C;are mild,
                    moderate, and accus-<lb/>tomed, from the effects of their idleness,<lb/>to the
                    greatest privations. Formerly,<lb/>excited to labour by the Jesuits, they<lb/>
                    did not want for food. The fathers<lb/>cultivated maize, French beans, (<hi
                        rendition="#i">fri-<lb/>soles</hi>), and other European vegetables;<lb/>
                    they even planted sweet oranges and<lb/>tamarinds round the villages; and
                    they<lb/>possessed twenty or thirty thousand<lb/>head of cows and horses, in the
                    savan-<lb/>nahs of Atures and Carichana. They<lb/>had at their service a great
                    number of<lb/>slaves and servants (<hi rendition="#i">peones</hi>), to
                    take<lb/>care of their herds. Nothing is now<lb/>cultivated but a little
                    cassava, and a few<lb/><cb/>plantains. The fertility of the soil<lb/>however is
                    such, that at Atures I count-<lb/>ed on a single branch of musa 108<lb/>fruits,
                    4 or 5 of which would almost<lb/>suffice for the daily nourishment of a<lb/>
                    man. The culture of maize is entirely<lb/>neglected, and the horses and cows
                    have<lb/>disappeared. There now remains in<lb/>testimony of the ancient
                    cultivation of<lb/>these countries, and the industrious ac-<lb/>tivity of the
                    first missionaries, only a<lb/>few trunks of the orange and tamarind<lb/>in the
                    savannahs, surrounded by wild<lb/>trees.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The tigers, or jaguars, which are less<lb/>dangerous for the cattle than
                    the bats,<lb/>come into the village at Atures, and<lb/>devour the pigs of the
                    poor Indians.<lb/>The missionary related to us a striking<lb/>instance of the
                    familiarity of these ani-<lb/>mals, upon the whole so ferocious.<lb/>Some months
                    before our arrival, a<lb/>jaguar, which was thought to be young,<lb/>though of a
                    large size, had wounded<lb/>a child in playing with him; I use<lb/>confidently
                    this expression, which may<lb/>seem strange, having on the spot veri-<lb/>fied
                    facts which are not without interest<lb/>in the history of the manners of
                    animals.<lb/>Two Indian children, a boy and a girl,<lb/>about eight and nine
                    years of age,<lb/>were seated on the grass near the village<lb/>of Atures, in
                    the middle of a savannah,<lb/>which we have often traversed. At<lb/>two
                    o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon, a jaguar<lb/>issued from the forest, and
                    approached<lb/>the children, bounding around them;<lb/>sometimes he hid himself
                    in the high<lb/>grass, sometimes he sprang forward,<lb/>his back bent, his head
                    hung down, in<lb/>the manner of our cats. The little boy,<lb/>ignorant of his
                    danger, seemed to be<lb/>sensible of it only when the jaguar<lb/>with one of his
                    paws gave him some<lb/>blows on the head. These blows, at<lb/>first slight,
                    became ruder and ruder;<lb/>the claws of the jaguar wounded the<lb/>child, and
                    the blood flowed with vio-<lb/>lence. The little girl then took a branch<lb/>of
                    a tree, struck the animal, and it fled<lb/>from her. The Indians ran up at
                    the<lb/>cries of the children, and saw the <lb/>jaguar, which retired bounding,
                    without<lb/>the least show of resistance.</p>
                <p> &#x201C;The little boy was brought to us,<lb/>who appeared lively and intelligent.<lb/>
                    <pb n="412" facs="#f0004"/>
                    <cb/>The claw of the jaguar had taken away<lb/>the skin from the lower part of
                    the fore-<lb/>head, and there was a second scar at<lb/>the top of the
                    head.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>&#x201C;It was among the cataracts that we<lb/>began to hear of the hairy man of
                    the<lb/>woods, called salvaje, that carries off<lb/>women, constructs huts, and
                    sometimes<lb/>eats human flesh. The <choice>

                    anthropomorphous mon-<lb/>key, which they singularly dread.<lb/>Father Gili
                    gravely relates the history<lb/>of a lady in the town of San Carlos,<lb/>who
                    much praised the gentle character<lb/>and attentions of the man of the
                    woods.<lb/>She lived several years with one in<lb/>great domestic harmony, and
                    only re-<lb/>quested some hunters to take her back,<lb/>&#x2018;because she was
                    tired, she and her<lb/>children (a little hairy also), of living<lb/>far from
                    the church and the sacra-<lb/>ments.&#x201D; The same author,
                    notwith-<lb/>standing his credulity, confesses, that he<lb/>had not been able to
                    find an Indian,<lb/>who asserted positively that he had seen<lb/>the <hi
                        rendition="#i">salvaje</hi> with his own eyes. This<lb/>fable, which the
                    missionaries, the Eu-<lb/>ropean planters, and the negroes of Af-<lb/>rica, have
                    no doubt embellished with<lb/>many features taken from the descrip-<lb/>tion of
                    the manners of the ourang ou-<lb/>tang, the gibbon, the jocko or
                    chimpan-<lb/>zee, and the pongo, pursued us during<lb/>five years from the
                    northern to the<lb/>southern hemisphere; and we were<lb/>every where blamed, in
                    the most culti-<lb/>vated class of society, for being the on-<lb/>ly persons to
                    doubt the existence of<lb/>the great anthropomorphous monkey of<lb/>America. We
                    shall first observe,<lb/>that there are certain regions, where<lb/>this belief
                    is particularly prevalent<lb/>among the people; such are the banks<lb/>of the
                    Upper Oroonoko, the valley of<lb/>Upar near the Lake of Maracaybo,
                    the<lb/>mountains of Santa Martha and of Me-<lb/>rida, the provinces of Quixos,
                    and the<lb/>banks of the Amazon near Tomependa.<lb/>In all these places, so
                    distant one from<lb/>the other, it is repeated, that the <hi rendition="#i"
                        >salvaje</hi><lb/>is easily recognized by the traces of its<lb/>feet, the
                    toes of which are turned back-<lb/>ward. But if there exist a monkey
                    of<lb/><cb/>a large size in the New Continent, how<lb/>has it happened, that
                    during three cen-<lb/>turies no man worthy of belief has been<lb/>able to
                    procure the skin of one? Sev-<lb/>eral hypotheses present themselves to<lb/>the
                    mind, in order to explain the source<lb/>of so ancient an error or belief.
                    Has<lb/>the famous <hi rendition="#i">capuchin</hi> monkey of Es-<lb/>meralda,
                    the canine teeth of which are<lb/>more than six lines and a half long, the<lb/>
                    physiognomy much more like man&#x2019;s<lb/>than that of the ourang outang,
                    and<lb/>which, when irritated, rubs its beard<lb/>with its hand, give rise to
                    the fable of<lb/>the <hi rendition="#i">salvaje</hi>? It is not so large indeed
                    as<lb/>the coaita (<hi rendition="#i">simia paniscus</hi>;) but when<lb/>seen at
                    the top of a tree, and the head<lb/>only visible, it might easily be
                    taken<lb/>for a human being. It may be also<lb/>(and this opinion appears to me
                    the<lb/>most probable,) that the man of the<lb/>woods was one of those large
                    bears, the<lb/>footsteps of which resemble those of a<lb/>man, and which is
                    believed in every<lb/>country to attack women. The ani-<lb/>mal killed in my
                    time at the foot of the<lb/>mountains of Merida, and sent, by the<lb/>name of
                        <hi rendition="#i">salvaje</hi> to Colonel Ungaro, the<lb/>governor of the
                    province Varinas, was<lb/>in fact a bear with black and

                    tormented by insects<lb/>flying in the air, and how the multitude<lb/>of these
                    little animals may render vast<lb/>regions wholly uninhabitable. How-<lb/>ever
                    accustomed you may be to endure<lb/>pain without complaint, however
                    lively<lb/>an interest you may take in the objects<lb/>of your researches, it is

                    affords an inexhaustible subject of<lb/>conversation. When two persons

                    &#x2018;How did<lb/>you find the zancudoes during the<lb/>night? How are we to
                    day for the<lb/>moschettoes.&#x2019; These questions remind<lb/>us of a Chinese
                    form of politeness,<lb/>which indicates the ancient state of the<lb/>country

                <p>&#x201C;I have just shown, from my own<lb/>observations, how much the
                    geograph-<lb/>ical distribution of venomous insects<lb/>varies in this labyrinth
                    of rivers with<lb/>white and black waters. It were to<lb/>be wished, that a
                    learned entomologist<lb/>could study on the spot the specific<lb/>differences of
                    these noxious insects,<lb/>which in the torrid zone, in spite of<lb/>their
                    littleness, act an important part in<lb/>the economy of nature. What
                    appear-<lb/>ed to us very remarkable, and is a<lb/>fact, known to all the
                    missionaries, is,<lb/>that the different species do not asso-<lb/>ciate
                    together, and that at different<lb/>hours of the day you are stung by a
                    dis-<lb/>tinct species. Every time that the<lb/>scene changes, and to use the
                    simple<lb/>expression of the missionaries, other<lb/>insects &#x2018;mount
                    guard,&#x2019; you have a few<lb/>minutes, often a quarter of an hour, of<lb/>
                    repose. The insects that disappear<lb/>have not their places instantly
                    supplied<lb/>in equal numbers by their successors.<lb/>From half after six in
                    the morning till<lb/>five in the afternoon, the air is filled<lb/>with
                    moschettoes; which have not, as<lb/>we find related in some travels, the
                    form<lb/>of our gnats, but that of a small fly.<lb/>They are simuliums of the
                    family<lb/>nemocer&#x00E6; of the system of Latreille.<lb/><cb/>Their sting is
                    as painful as that of<lb/><hi rendition="#i">stomoxes</hi>. It leaves a little
                        reddish-<lb break="hyph-yes"/>brown spot, which is extravasated and<lb/>
                    coagulated blood, where their proboscis<lb/>has pierced the skin. An hour
                    before<lb/>sun-set a species of small gnats, called<lb/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">tempraneros</hi>, because they appear also<lb/>at sun-rise,
                    take the place of the mos-<lb/>chettoes. Their presence scarcely lasts<lb/>an
                    hour and a half; they disappear<lb/>between six and seven in the evening,<lb/>
                    or, as they say here, after the <hi rendition="#i">Angelus</hi><lb/>(<hi
                        rendition="#i">a la oracion</hi>). After a few minutes<lb/>repose, you feel
                    yourself stung by<lb/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">zancudoes</hi>, another species of gnat<lb/>(culex) with very
                    long legs. The<lb/>zancudo, the proboscis of which con-<lb/>tains a sharp
                    pointed sucker, causes the<lb/>most acute pain, and a swelling that
                    re-<lb/>mains several weeks. Its hum resem-<lb/>bles that of our gnats in
                    Europe, but is<lb/>louder and more prolonged. The In-<lb/>dians pretend to
                    distinguish &#x2018;by their<lb/>song&#x2019; the <hi rendition="#i"
                        >zancudoes</hi> and the <hi rendition="#i">tempra-<lb/>neroes</hi>; the
                    latter of which are real<lb/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">twilight insects</hi>, while the <hi rendition="#i"
                        >zancudoes</hi><lb/>are most frequently <hi rendition="#i">nocturnal
                        insects</hi>,<lb/>and disappear towards sun-rise.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The <hi rendition="#i">culices</hi> of South America<lb/>have generally
                    the wings, corselet, and<lb/>legs of an azure colour, annulated, and<lb/>
                    variable from a mixture of spots of a<lb/>metallic lustre. Here, as in
                    Europe,<lb/>the males, which are distinguished by<lb/>their feathered
                    antenn&#x00E6;, are extremely<lb/>rare; you are seldom stung except by<lb/>
                    females. The preponderance of this<lb/>sex explains the immense increase
                    of<lb/>the species, each female laying several<lb/>hundred eggs. In going up one
                    of the<lb/>great rivers of America, it is observed,<lb/>that the appearance of a
                    new species of<lb/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">culex</hi> denotes the approximity of a<lb/>new stream
                    flowing in.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The whites born in the torrid zone<lb/>walk barefoot with impunity in
                    the<lb/>same apartment where a European re-<lb/>cently landed is exposed to the
                    attack<lb/>of the <hi rendition="#i">niguas</hi> or <hi rendition="#i"
                        >chegoes</hi> (<hi rendition="#i">pulex pene-<lb/>trans</hi>.) These
                    animals, almost invisi-<lb/>ble to the eye, get under the nails of<lb/>the feet,
                    and there acquire the size of<lb/>a small pea by the quick increase of
                    its<lb/>eggs, which are placed in a bag under<lb/>the belly of the insect. The
                        <hi rendition="#i">nigua</hi>,<lb/>therefore, distinguishes, what the
                        most<lb/><pb n="414" facs="#f0006"/>
                    <cb/>delicate chemical analysis could not<lb/>distinguish, the cellular membrane
                    and<lb/>blood of a European from those of a<lb/>Creole white. It is not so with
                    the<lb/>moschettoes.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;In the day, even when labouring<lb/>at the oar, the natives, in order to
                    chase<lb/>the insects, are continually giving one<lb/>another smart slaps with
                    the palm of<lb/>the hand. Rude in all their move-<lb/>ments, they strike
                    themselves and their<lb/>comrades mechanically during their<lb/>sleep. The
                    violence of their blows re-<lb/>minds us of the Persian tale of the bear,<lb/>
                    that tried to kill with his paw the in-<lb/>sects on the forehead of his
                    sleeping<lb/>master. Near Maypures we saw some<lb/>young Indians seated in a
                    circle and<lb/>rubbing cruelly each others backs with<lb/>the bark of trees
                    dried at the fire. In-<lb/>dian women were occupied with a de-<lb/>gree of
                    patience, of which the copper-<lb break="hyph-yes"/>coloured race alone are
                    capable, in ex-<lb/>tirpating by means of a sharp bone the<lb/>little mass of
                    coagulated blood, that<lb/>forms the centre of every sting, and<lb/>gives the
                    skin a speckled appearance.<lb/>One of the most barbarous nations of<lb/>the
                    Oroonoko, that of the Otomacs, is<lb/>acquainted with the use of moschetto<lb/>
                    curtains (<hi rendition="#i">mosquiteros</hi>) formed of a<lb/>tissue of fibres
                    of the palm tree, <hi rendition="#i">muri-<lb/>chi</hi>. We had lately seen,
                    that at<lb/>Higuerote, on the coast of Caraccas,<lb/>the people of a copper
                    colour sleep<lb/>buried in the sand. In the villages of<lb/>the Rio Magdalena
                    the Indians often<lb/>invited us to stretch ourselves with<lb/>them on ox-skins,
                    near the church, in<lb/>the middle of the <hi rendition="#i">plaza grande</hi>,
                    where<lb/>they had assembled all the cows in the<lb/>neighbourhood. The
                    proximity of<lb/>cattle give some repose to man. The<lb/>Indians of the Upper
                    Oroonoko and<lb/>the Cassiquiare, seeing that Mr. Bon-<lb/>pland could not
                    prepare his herbal, on<lb/>account of the continual torment of
                    the<lb/>moschettoes, invited him to enter their<lb/>oveus, (<hi rendition="#i"
                        >hornitos</hi>.) Thus they call lit-<lb/>tle chambers, without doors or
                    win-<lb/>dows, into which they creep horizon-<lb/>tally through a very small
                    opening.<lb/>When they have driven away the in-<lb/>sects by means of a fire of
                    wet brush-<lb break="hyph-yes"/>wood, which emits a great deal of<lb/>smoke,
                    they close the opening of the<lb/><cb/>oven. The absence of moschettoes
                    is<lb/>purchased clearly enough by the exces-<lb/>sive heat of stagnant air, and
                    the smoke<lb/>of a torch of <hi rendition="#i">copal</hi>, which lights the
                    ov-<lb/>en during your stay in it. Mr. Bon-<lb/>pland, with courage and patience
                    well<lb/>worthy of praise, dried hundreds of <lb/>plants, shut up in these <hi
                        rendition="#i">hornitos</hi> of the<lb/>Indians.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>By this time we fancy our readers<lb/>are as well acquainted with the
                    habits<lb/>of the moschettoes, as if they had been<lb/>bitten by them all over;
                    and further<lb/>knowledge being unnecessary, we shall<lb/>advance to other
                    subjects.</p>
                <p>Above the cataract of Atures, at the<lb/>mouth of the Rio Calaniapo, Mr.
                    Hum-<lb/>boldt gives the following account of an<lb/>extinct tribe:</p>
                <p>&#x201C;We were shown at a distance, on<lb/>the right of the river, the rocks
                    that sur-<lb/>round the cavern of Ataruipe; but we<lb/>had not time to visit the
                    cemetery of<lb/>the destroyed tribe of the Atures. We<lb/>regretted this so much
                    the more, as<lb/>father Zea was never weary of talking<lb/>to us of the
                    skeletons painted with<lb/>annotta, which this cavern contained;<lb/>of the
                    large vases of baked earth, in<lb/>which the bones of separate
                    families<lb/>appeared to be collected; and of many<lb/>other curious objects,
                    which we propos-<lb/>ed to examine at our return from the<lb/>Rio
                    Negro.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>At Maypure, higher up, we hear<lb/>more of the pottery of the Indians:</p>
                <p>&#x201C;In every part of the forests, far<lb/>from any human habitation, on
                    digging<lb/>the earth, fragments of pottery and delft<lb/>are found. The taste
                    for this kind of<lb/>fabrication seems to have been common<lb/>heretofore to the
                    natives of both Amer-<lb/>icas. To the north of Mexico,&#x2014;on<lb/>the banks
                    of the Rio Gila&#x2014; among the<lb/>ruins of an Azteck city&#x2014;in the
                    United<lb/>States&#x2014;near the <hi rendition="#i">tumuli</hi> of the
                    Miamis;<lb/>in Florida&#x2014;and in every place where<lb/>any trace of ancient
                    civilization could<lb/>be found, the soil covers fragments of<lb/>painted
                    pottery; and the extreme re-<lb/>semblances of the ornaments they dis-<lb/>play
                    is striking. Savage nations, and<lb/>those civilized people, who are
                    con-<lb/>demned by their political and religious<lb/>institutions always to
                    imitate them-<lb/>selves, strive, as if by instinct, to perpet-<lb/><pb n="415"
                        facs="#f0007"/>
                    <cb/>uate the same forms, to preserve a pecu-<lb/>liar type or style, and to
                    follow the<lb/>methods and processes which were em-<lb/>ployed by their
                    ancestors. In North<lb/>America, fragments of delft have been<lb/>discovered in
                    places where lines of for-<lb/>tification are found, and the walls of<lb/>towns
                    constructed by an unknown na-<lb/>tion, now entirely extinct. The
                    paint-<lb/>ings on these fragments have a great<lb/>similitude to those which
                    are executed<lb/>in our days on earthenware by the na-<lb/>tives of Louisiana
                    and Florida. Thus<lb/>too the Indians of Maypure often paint-<lb/>ed before our
                    eyes the same ornaments<lb/>as we had observed in the cavern of<lb/>Ataruipe, on
                    the vases containing hu-<lb/>man bones. They are real <hi rendition="#i"
                        >grecques</hi>,<lb/>meandrites, and figures of crocodiles,<lb/>of monkeys,
                    and of a large quadruped,<lb/>which I could not recognize, though it<lb/>has
                    always the same squat form.&#x201D; </p>
                <p>We cannot, even in the midst of the<lb/>interesting works which are at
                    present<lb/>almost daily issuing from the press, do<lb/>better than continue to
                    devote a few<lb/>more pages to the agreeable narrative<lb/>of this enterprising
                    and intelligent trav-<lb/>eller. We have remarked upon the<lb/>extraordinary
                    degree of general knowl-<lb/>edge which he brings to bear on any<lb/>topic he is
                    illustrating. The following<lb/>is an admirable example of the truth of<lb/>this
                    position: </p>
                <p>&#x201C;Every hemisphere produces plants<lb/>of a different species; and it is
                    not by<lb/>the diversity of climates that we can at-<lb/>tempt to explain why
                    equinoctial Afri-<lb/>ca has no laurineæ, and the New World<lb/>no heaths; why
                    the calceolariæ are<lb/>found only in the Southern hemisphere:<lb/>why the birds
                    of the continent of In-<lb/>dia glow with colours less splendid<lb/>than the
                    birds of the hot parts of Amer-<lb/>ica; finally, why the tiger is
                    pecu-<lb/>liar to Asia, and the ornithorhincus to<lb/>New-Holland. In the
                    vegetable as<lb/>well as in the animal kingdom, the<lb/>causes of the
                    distribution of the species<lb/>are among the number of mysteries,<lb/>which
                    natural philosophy cannot reach.<lb/>This science is not occupied in the
                    in-<lb/>vestigation of the origin of beings, but<lb/>of the laws according to
                    which they are<lb/>distributed on the globe. It examines<lb/>the things that
                    are, the coexistence of<lb/><cb/>vegetable and animal forms, in each
                    lati-<lb/>tude, at different heights, and at differ-<lb/>ent degrees of
                    temperature; it studies<lb/>the relations under which particular<lb/>
                    organizations are more vigorously de-<lb/>veloped, multiplied or modified;
                    but<lb/>it approaches not problems, the solution<lb/>of which is impossible,
                    since they touch<lb/>the origin, the first existence of a germe<lb/>of life. We
                    may add, that the attempts<lb/>that have been made to explain
                    the<lb/>distribution of various species on the<lb/>globe, by the sole influence
                    of climate,<lb/>date at a period when physical geogra-<lb/>phy was still in its
                    infancy; when, re-<lb/>curring incessantly to pretended con-<lb/>trasts between
                    the two worlds, it was<lb/>imagined, that the whole of Africa and<lb/>of America
                    resembled the deserts of<lb/>Egypt, and the marshes of Cayenne.<lb/>At present,
                    when men judge of the state<lb/>of things not from one type
                    arbitrarily<lb/>chosen, but from positive knowledge, it<lb/>is ascertained that
                    the two continents,<lb/>in their immense extent, contain coun-<lb/>tries that
                    are altogether analogous.<lb/>There are regions of America, as bar-<lb/>ren and
                    burning as the interior of Af-<lb/>rica. The islands that produce the<lb/>spices
                    of India are scarcely remarkable<lb/>for their dryness; and it is not on
                    ac-<lb/>count of the humidity of the climate,<lb/>as it has been affirmed in
                    recent works,<lb/>that the New Continent is deprived of<lb/>those fine species
                    of laurineæ and my-<lb/>risticæ, which are found united in one<lb/>little corner
                    of the earth, in the Archi-<lb/>pelago of India. For some years past,<lb/>the
                    real cinnamon has been cultivated<lb/>with success in several parts of the
                    New<lb/>Continent; and a zone that produces<lb/>the coumarouna, the vanilla, the
                    puche-<lb/>ri, the pine-apple, the myrtus pimenta,<lb/>the balsam of tolu, the
                    myroxylon pe-<lb/>ruvianum, the crotons, the citrosmas,<lb/>the pejoa, the <hi
                        rendition="#i">incienso</hi> of the Silla of<lb/>Caraccas, the <hi
                        rendition="#i">quereme</hi>, the pancratium,<lb/>and so many majestic
                    liliaceous plants,<lb/>cannot be considered as destitute of<lb/>aromatics.
                    Besides, a dry air favours<lb/>the developement of the aromatic, or<lb/>exciting
                    properties, only in certain spe-<lb/>cies of plants. The most cruel
                    poisons<lb/>are produced in the most humid zone<lb/>of America: and it is
                    precisely under<lb/>the influence of the long rains of the<lb/><pb n="416"
                        facs="#f0008"/>
                    <cb/>tropics that the American pimento,<lb/>capsicum baccatum, the fruit of
                    which<lb/>is often as caustic and fiery as Indian<lb/>pepper, vegetates best.
                    From the<lb/>whole of these considerations, it follows,<lb/>1st, that the New
                    Continent possesses<lb/>spices, aromatics, and very active veg-<lb/>etable
                    poisons that are peculiar to it-<lb/>self, differing specifically from those
                    of<lb/>the ancient world; 2ndly, that the<lb/>primitive distribution of species
                    in the<lb/>torrid zone cannot be explained by the<lb/>influence of climate
                    solely, or by the<lb/>distribution of temperature, which we<lb/>observe in the
                    present state of our<lb/>planet; but that this difference of cli-<lb/>mates
                    leads us to perceive, why a given<lb/>type of organization developes
                    itself<lb/>more vigorously in such or such local<lb/>circumstances. We can
                    conceive, that<lb/>a small number of the families of plants,<lb/>for instance
                    the musaceæ and the<lb/>palms, cannot belong to very cold re-<lb/>gions, on
                    account of their internal<lb/>structure and the importance of
                    certain<lb/>organs; but we cannot explain why no<lb/>one of the family of
                    melastomas vege-<lb/>tates north of the parallel of thirty de-<lb/>grees, or why
                    no rose-tree belongs to<lb/>the southern hemisphere. Analogy of<lb/>climates is
                    often found in the two con-<lb/>tinents, without identity of
                    produc-<lb/>tions.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>Here follow some very curious ob-<lb/>servations on the difference of
                    colours<lb/>in rivers, springs, and lakes; but we<lb/>must pass them, and from
                    the Oroono-<lb/>ko <hi rendition="#i">portage</hi> our readers across by
                    Pim-<lb/>ichin to the Rio Negro, on the frontier<lb/>of Brazil. Here is seen in
                    all its maj-<lb/>esty the <hi rendition="#i">phiguao</hi> or pirajao palm.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;Its trunk, armed with thorns, is<lb/>more than sixty feet high; its
                    leaves<lb/>are pinnated, very thin, undulated, and<lb/>frizzled towards the
                    points. Nothing<lb/>is more extraordinary than the fruits of<lb/>this tree;
                    every cluster contains<lb/>from fifty to eighty; they are yellow like<lb/>
                    apples, grow purple in proportion as<lb/>they ripen, two or three inches
                    thick;<lb/>and generally, from abortion, without<lb/>a kernel. Among the eighty
                    or ninety<lb/>species of palm-trees that are peculiar<lb/>to the New
                    Continent,&#x201D; adds Mr. H.,<lb/>&#x201C;which I have enumerated in the <hi
                        rendition="#i">Nova<lb/>Genera Plantarum
                    &#xE6;quinoctialum</hi>,<lb/><cb/>there are none in which the sarcocarp<lb/>is
                    developed in a manner so extraordi-<lb/>nary. The fruit of the <hi
                        rendition="#i">pirijao</hi> fur-<lb/>nishes a farinaceous substance, as
                    yel-<lb/>low as the yolk of an egg, slightly<lb/>saccharine, and extremely
                    nutritious.<lb/>It is eaten like plantains or potatoes,<lb/>boiled or roasted in
                    the ashes, and af-<lb/>fords an aliment as wholesome as it is<lb/>agreeable. The
                    Indians and the mis-<lb/>sionaries are unwearied in their praises<lb/>of this
                    noble palm-tree, which might be<lb/>called the <hi rendition="#i"
                        >peach-palm</hi>, and which we<lb/>found cultivated in abundance at
                    San<lb/>Fernando, San Balthasar, Santa Bar-<lb/>bara, and wherever we advanced
                    to-<lb/>wards the south or the east along the<lb/>banks of the Atabapo and the
                    Upper<lb/>Oroonoko. In those wild regions are<lb/>we involuntarily reminded of
                    the as-<lb/>sertion of Linn&#xE6;us, that the country of<lb/>palm-trees was the
                    first abode of our<lb/>species, and that man is essentially<lb/><hi
                        rendition="#i">palmivorous</hi>. On examining the prov-<lb/>ision
                    accumulated in the huts of the<lb/>Indians, we perceive that their
                    subsist-<lb/>ence during several months of the<lb/>year depends as much on the
                    farina-<lb/>ceous fruit of the <hi rendition="#i">pirijao</hi>, as on
                    the<lb/>cassava and plantain. The tree bears<lb/>fruit but once a year, but to
                    the amount<lb/>of three clusters, consequently from one<lb/>hundred and fifty to
                    two hundred<lb/>fruits.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>Here, also, is the gigantic bombax<lb/>(<hi rendition="#i">bombax ceila</hi>) one
                    of which, as they<lb/>sailed along, attracted the notice of<lb/>the travellers,
                    and they landed to meas-<lb/>ure it. &#x201C;The height (we are told)<lb/>was
                    nearly one hundred and twenty<lb/>feet, and the diameter between
                    fourteen<lb/>and fifteen. This enormous effort of<lb/>vegetation surprised us
                    the more, as we<lb/>had, till then, seen on the banks of the<lb/>Atabapo, only
                    small trees with slender<lb/>trunks, which from afar resembled<lb/>young
                    cherry-trees. The Indians as-<lb/>sured us, that these small trees do
                    not<lb/>form a very extensive group. They are<lb/>checked in their growth by the
                    inunda-<lb/>tions of the river; while the dry<lb/>grounds near the Atabapo, the
                    Temi,<lb/>and the Tuamina, furnish excellent tim-<lb/>ber for
                    building.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>Thus (as we have stated), inter-<lb/>spersed with anecdote, does Mr. Hum-<lb/><pb
                        n="417" facs="#f0009"/><cb/>boldt vary his entertaining volumes;
                    and<lb/>that our review may partake of the<lb/>character of its subject, we
                    shall con-<lb/>clude the present division of it by copy-<lb/>ing a very
                    affecting story. Where the<lb/>Atabapo enters the Rio Temi, the nar-<lb/>rative
                    says:</p>
                <p>&#x201C;Before we reached its confluence,<lb/>a granitic hummock, that rises on
                    the<lb/>western bank, near the mouth of the<lb/>Guasacavi, fixed our attention;
                    it is<lb/>called <hi rendition="#i">Rock of the Guahiba woman</hi>,<lb/>or the
                    Rock of the Mother, <hi rendition="#i">Piedra de<lb/>la Madre</hi>. We inquired
                    the cause of<lb/>so singular a denomination. Father<lb/>Zea could not satisfy
                    our curiosity;<lb/>but some weeks after, another mission-<lb/>ary, one of the
                    predecessors of this<lb/>ecclesiastic, whom we found settled at<lb/>San Fernando
                    as president of the mis-<lb/>sions, related to us an event, which I<lb/>recorded
                    in my journal, and which ex-<lb/>cited in our minds the most
                    painful<lb/>feelings. If, in these solitary scenes,<lb/>man scarcely leaves
                    behind him any<lb/>trace of his existence, it is doubly hu-<lb/>miliating for a
                    European to see perpet-<lb/>uated by the name of a rock, by one of<lb/>those
                    imperishable monuments of<lb/>nature, the remembrance of the
                    moral<lb/>degradation of our species, and the con-<lb/>trast between the virtue
                    of a savage,<lb/>and the barbarism of civilized man!</p>
                <p>&#x201C;In 1797 the missionary of San<lb/>Fernando had led his Indians to
                    the<lb/>banks of the Rio Guaviare, on one of<lb/>those hostile incursions, which
                    are<lb/>prohibited alike by religion and the<lb/>Spanish laws. They found in an<lb/><choice>
                        <sic>Italian</sic>
                        <corr type="editorial">Indian</corr>
                    </choice> hut, a Guahiba mother with<lb/>her three children, two of whom were
                    still<lb/>infants. They were occupied in pre-<lb/>paring the flour of Cassava.
                    Resist-<lb/>ance was impossible; the father was<lb/>gone to fish, and the mother
                    tried in<lb/>vain to flee with her children. Scarce-<lb/>ly had she reached the
                    savannah, when<lb/>she was seized by the Indians of the<lb/>mission, who go to
                        <hi rendition="#i">hunt men</hi>, like the<lb/>whites and the negroes in
                    Africa. The<lb/>mother and her children were bound,<lb/>and dragged to the bank
                    of the river.<lb/>The monk, seated in his boat, waited<lb/>the issue of an
                    expedition, of which he<lb/>partook not the danger. Had the<lb/><cb/>mother made
                    too violent a resistance,<lb/>the Indians would have killed her,
                    for<lb/>everything is permitted when they go<lb/>to the conquest of souls <hi
                        rendition="#i">(la conquista<lb/>espiritual,)</hi> and it is children in
                    partic-<lb/>ular they seek to capture, in order to<lb/>treat them, in the
                    mission, as <hi rendition="#i">poitos</hi>, or<lb/>slaves of the Christians. The
                    prisoners<lb/>were carried to San Fernando in the <lb/>hope, that the mother
                    would be unable<lb/>to find her way back to her home, by<lb/>land. Separated
                    from those children who<lb/>had accompanied their father on the<lb/>day in which
                    she had been carried off,<lb/>this unhappy woman showed signs of<lb/>the deepest
                    despair. She attempted to<lb/>take back to her family the children<lb/>who had
                    been snatched away by the<lb/>missionary, and fled with them repeat-<lb/>edly
                    from the village of San Fernando,<lb/>but the Indians never failed to
                    seize<lb/>her anew; and the missionary, after<lb/>having caused her to be
                    mercilessly<lb/>beaten, took the cruel resolution of sep-<lb/>arating the mother
                    from the two chil-<lb/>dren who had been carried off with<lb/>her. She was
                    conveyed alone toward<lb/>the missions of the Rio Negro, going<lb/>up the
                    Atabapo. Slightly bound, she<lb/>was seated at the bow of the boat,
                    ig-<lb/>norant of the fate that awaited her; but<lb/>she judged by the direction
                    of the<lb/>sun, that she was removed farther and<lb/>farther from her hut and
                    her native<lb/>country. She succeeded in breaking<lb/>her bonds, threw herself
                    into the water,<lb/>and swam to the left bank of the Ata-<lb/>bapo. The current
                    carried her to a<lb/>shelf of rock, which bears her name to<lb/>this day. She
                    landed, and took shelter<lb/>in the woods, but the president of the<lb/>missions
                    ordered the Indians to row to<lb/>the shore, and follow the traces of
                    the<lb/>Guahiba. In the evening she was<lb/>brought back. Stretched upon
                    the<lb/>rock <hi rendition="#i">(la Piedra de la Madre)</hi> a
                    cruel<lb/>punishment was inflicted on her with<lb/>those straps of manatee
                    leather, which<lb/>serve for whips in that country, and<lb/>with which the
                    alcades are always fur-<lb/>nished. This unhappy woman, her<lb/>hands tied
                    behind her back with strong<lb/>stalks of <hi rendition="#i">mavacure</hi>, was
                    then dragged<lb/>to the mission of Javita.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;She was there thrown into one of<lb/><pb n="418" facs="#f0010"/>
                    <cb/>the caravanseras that are called <hi rendition="#i">Casa del<lb/>Rey</hi>.
                    It was the rainy season, and<lb/>the night was profoundly dark. For-<lb/>ests,
                    till then believed to be impenetra-<lb/>ble, separated the mission of
                    Javita<lb/>from that of San Fernando, which was<lb/>twenty-five leagues distant
                    in a straight<lb/>line. No other part is known than<lb/>that by the rivers; no
                    man ever attempt-<lb/>ed to go by land from one village to<lb/>another, were
                    they only a few leagues<lb/>apart. But such difficulties do not<lb/>stop a
                    mother, who is separated from<lb/>her children. Her children are at
                    San<lb/>Fernando de Atabapo; she must find<lb/>them again, she must execute her
                    pro-<lb/>ject of delivering them from the hands<lb/>of Christians, of bringing
                    them back to<lb/>their father on the banks of the Gua-<lb/>viare. The Guahibi
                    was carelessly<lb/>guarded in the caravansera. Her arms<lb/>being wounded, the
                    Indians of Javita<lb/>had loosened her bonds, unknown to<lb/>the missionary and
                    the alcades. She<lb/>succeeded by the help of her teeth in<lb/>breaking them
                    entirely; disappeared<lb/>during the night; and at the fourth ri-<lb/>sing was
                    seen at the mission of San<lb/>Fernando, hovering around the hut<lb/>where her
                    children were confined.<lb/>&#x2018;What that woman performed,&#x2019;
                    added<lb/>the missionary, who gave us this sad<lb/>narrative, &#x2018;the most
                    robust Indian<lb/>would not have ventured to undertake.<lb/>She traversed the
                    woods at a season<lb/>when the sky is constantly covered<lb/>with clouds, and
                    the sun during whole<lb/><cb/>days appears but for a few minutes.<lb/>Did the
                    course of the waters direct her<lb/>way? The inundations of the
                    rivers<lb/>forced her to go far from the banks of<lb/>the main stream, through
                    the midst of<lb/>woods where the movement of the wa-<lb/>ter is almost
                    imperceptible. How often<lb/>she must have been stopped by the<lb/>thorny
                    lianas, that form a network<lb/>around the trunks they entwine? How<lb/>often
                    must she have swum across the<lb/>rivulets, that run into the Atabapo!<lb/>This
                    unfortunate woman was asked<lb/>how she had sustained herself during<lb/>four
                    days! She said, that, exhaust-<lb/>ed with fatigue, she could find no
                    other<lb/>nourishment than those great black ants<lb/>called <hi rendition="#i"
                        >vachacos</hi>, which climb the trees<lb/>in long bands, to suspend on them
                    their<lb/>resinous nests.&#x2019; We pressed the mis-<lb/>sionary to tell us,
                    whether the Guahibi<lb/>had peacefully enjoyed the happiness<lb/>of remaining
                    with her children; and if<lb/>any repentance had followed this excess<lb/>of
                    cruelty. He would not satisfy our<lb/>curiosity; but at our return from
                    the<lb/>Rio Negro, we learned that the Indian<lb/>mother was not allowed time to
                    cure<lb/>her wounds, but was again separated<lb/>from her children, and sent to
                    one of<lb/>the missions of the Upper Oroonoko.<lb/>There she died, refusing all
                    kind of<lb/>nourishment, as savages do in great<lb/>calamities.</p>

                <p>This journal is so pregnant with<lb/>instructive and interesting matter,<lb/>that
                    we could hardly, as we think<lb/>place any thing better before our
                    read-<lb/>ers, though we might be more instant<lb/>with a greater variety of
                    novelty. We<lb/>therefore continue our extracts.The<lb/>following is a curious
                    account of the<lb/><hi rendition="#i">Indian Rubber:</hi>&#x2014;&#x201C;Here
                    (says Mr.<lb/>H. at the mission of St. Balthasar on<lb/>the Atabapo) we saw, for
                    the first<lb/>time, that white and fungous substance,<lb/>which I have made
                    known by the name<lb/>of <hi rendition="#i">dapicho</hi> and <hi rendition="#i"
                        >zapis.</hi> We immedi-<lb/>ately perceived, that it was analogous<lb/>to
                    the <hi rendition="#i">elastic resin;</hi> but, as the In-<lb/>dians made us
                    understand by signs, that<lb/>it was found under ground, we were<lb/>inclined to
                    think, till we arrived at the<lb/>mission of Javita, that the <hi rendition="#i"
                        >dapicho</hi> was<lb/>a fossil caoutchouc, though different<lb/>from the
                    elastic bitumen of Derbyshire.<lb/>A poimisano Indian, seated by the
                    fire,<lb/>in the hut of the missionary, was em-<lb/>ployed in reducing the <hi
                        rendition="#i">dapicho</hi> into<lb/>black caoutchouc. He had spitted
                    several<lb/>bits on a slender stick, and was<lb/>roasting them like meat. The
                        <hi rendition="#i">dapi-<lb/>cho</hi> blackens in proportion as it
                    grows<lb/>softer, and gains in elasticity. The<lb/>resinous and aromatic smell,
                    which filled<lb/>the hut, seemed to indicate, that this<lb/>coloration is the
                    effect of the decompo-<lb/>sition of a carburet of hydrogen, and<lb/>that the
                    carbon appears in proportion<lb/>as the hydrogen burns at a low heat.<lb/>The
                    Indian beat the softened and<lb/>blackened mass with a piece of brazil<lb/>wood,
                    ending in the form of a club; he<lb/>then kneaded the <hi rendition="#i"
                        >dapicho</hi> into balls of<lb/>three or four inches in diameter,
                    and<lb/><cb/>let it cool. These balls exactly resem-<lb/>ble the caoutchouc of
                    the shops, but<lb/>their surface remains in general slightly<lb/>viscous. They
                    are used at San Bal-<lb/>thasar in the Indian game of tennis,<lb/>which is so
                    celebrated among the in-<lb/>habitants of Uruana and Encaramada;<lb/>they are
                    cut into cylinders, to be used<lb/>as corks, and are far preferable to<lb/>those
                    made of the bark of the cork-<lb break="hyph-yes"/>tree.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>Soon after, we obtained<lb/>precise information respecting this
                    sub-<lb/>stance:&#x2014;it was shown us at the<lb/>depth of two or three feet,
                    in a marshy<lb/>soil, between the roots of two trees<lb/>known by the name of
                    the <hi rendition="#i">jacio</hi> and<lb/>the <hi rendition="#i">curvana.</hi>
                    The first is the hevea<lb/>of Aublet, or siphonia of the modern<lb/>botanists,
                    known to furnish the caout-<lb/>chouc of commerce in Cayenne and<lb/>the Grand
                    Para; the second has pin-<lb/>nate leaves, and its juice is milky, but<lb/>very
                    thin, and almost destitute of vis-<lb/>cocity. The <hi rendition="#i"
                        >dapicho</hi> appears to be the<lb/>result of an extravasation of the
                    sap<lb/>from the roots. This extravasation<lb/>takes place more especially when
                    the<lb/>trees have attained a great age, and the<lb/>interior of the trunk
                    begins to decay.<lb/>The bark and alburnum crack; and<lb/>thus is effected
                    naturally, what the art<lb/>of man performs to collect in abun-<lb/>dance the
                    milky juices of the hevea,<lb/>the castilloa, and the caoutchouc
                    fig<lb/>tree.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>The river Temi, near the banks of<lb/>which this production is found in
                    suffi-<lb/>cient quantities to supply all Europe,<lb/>runs through forests which
                    overshadow<lb/>it in so wild and luxuriant a manner<lb/><pb n="470"

                    <cb/>as almost to mingle together the crea-<lb/>tures of the several elements of

                <p>&#x201C;The Indians (says Mr. H.) made<lb/>us leave the bed of the river; and
                    we<lb/>went up towards the south, across the<lb/>forest, through paths <hi
                        rendition="#i">(sendas)</hi> that is,<lb/>through open channels of four or
                    five<lb/>feet broad. The depth of the water<lb/>seldom exceeds half a fathom. These<lb/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">sendas</hi> are formed in the inundated<lb/>forest-like paths
                    on dry ground. The<lb/>Indians, in going from one mission to<lb/>another, pass
                    with their boats as much<lb/>as possible by the same way; but
                    the<lb/>communications not being frequent, the<lb/>force of vegetation sometimes
                    produ-<lb/>ces unexpected obstacles. An Indian,<lb/>furnished with a <hi
                        rendition="#i">machette</hi> (a great<lb/>knife, the blade of which is
                    fourteen<lb/>inches long,) stood at the head of our<lb/>boat, employed
                    continually in chopping<lb/>off the branches that cross each other<lb/>from the
                    two sides of the channel.<lb/>In the thickest part of the forest we<lb/>were
                    astonished by an extraordinary<lb/>noise. On beating the bushes, a shoal<lb/>of
                        <hi rendition="#i">toninas</hi> (fresh water dolphins) four<lb/>feet long,
                    surrounded our boat. These<lb/>animals had concealed themselves be-<lb/>neath
                    the branches of a fromager or<lb/>bombax ceiba. They fled across the<lb/>forest,
                    throwing out those spouts of<lb/>compressed air and water, which have<lb/>given
                    them in every language the name<lb/>of <hi rendition="#i">blowers.</hi> How
                    singular was this<lb/>spectacle in the middle of the land,<lb/>three or four
                    hundred leagues from the<lb/>mouths of the Oroonoko and the Ama-<lb/>zon! I am
                    not ignorant, that the ple-<lb/>uronectes of the Atlantic go up the<lb/>Loire as
                    far as Orleans; but I persist<lb/>in thinking, that the dolphins of
                    the<lb/>Temi, like those of the Ganges, and<lb/>like the skate (<hi
                        rendition="#i">raia</hi>) of the Oroonoko,<lb/>are of a species essentially
                    different from<lb/>the dolphins and skates of the ocean.<lb/>In the immense
                    rivers of South Amer-<lb/><cb/>ica, and the great lakes of North<lb/>America,
                    nature seems to repeat seve-<lb/>ral pelagic forms. The Nile has
                    no<lb/>porpoises: those of the sea go up the<lb/>Delta no farther than Biana and
                    Me-<lb/>tonbis toward Selamoun.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>But these <hi rendition="#i">fishes among the woods</hi>,<lb/>though the most
                    singular, were not the<lb/>most ungrateful of the animal creation<lb/>to the
                    startled Europeans. About this<lb/>region they had to stop to be cured of<lb/>an
                    evil under which they suffered for<lb/>two days. The author thus
                    describes<lb/>it:&#x2014;&#x201C;We felt an extraordinary irrita-<lb/>tion on
                    the joints of our fingers, and on<lb/>the backs of our hands. The
                    mission-<lb/>ary told us it was caused by the <hi rendition="#i"
                        >ara-<lb/>dores</hi>, (ploughman insects), which get<lb/>under the skin. We
                    could distinguish<lb/>with a lens nothing but streaks, or par-<lb/>allel and
                    whitish furrows. It is the<lb/>form of these furrows, that has obtained<lb/>for
                    the insect the name of <hi rendition="#i">ploughman</hi>. A<lb/>mulatto woman
                    was sent for, who boast-<lb/>ed to be thoroughly acquainted<lb/>with all the
                    little insects, that burrow<lb/>in the human skin; the <hi rendition="#i"
                        >chego</hi>, the <hi rendition="#i">nu-<lb/>che</hi>, the <hi rendition="#i"
                        >coya</hi>, and the <hi rendition="#i">arador</hi>; she was<lb/>the <hi
                        rendition="#i">curandera</hi>, or physician of the<lb/>place. She promised
                    to extirpate the<lb/>insects, that caused this smarting irrita-<lb/>tion, one by
                    one. She heated at a<lb/>lamp the point a little bit of very<lb/>hard wood, and
                    dug with this point the<lb/>furrows that marked the skin. After<lb/>long
                    researches, she announced with the<lb/>pedantic gravity peculiar to the
                    mulatto<lb/>race, that an <hi rendition="#i">arador</hi> was found. I saw<lb/>a
                    little round bag, which I suspected to<lb/>be the egg of an acarus. I was to
                    find<lb/>relief, when the mulatto woman had<lb/>succeeded in taking out three or
                    four<lb/>of these <hi rendition="#i">aradores</hi>. Having the skin<lb/>of both
                    hands filled with acari, I had not<lb/>the patience to wait the end of an
                    opera-<lb/>tion, which had already lasted till late<lb/>at night. The next day
                    an Indian of<lb/>Javita cured us radically, and with sur-<lb/>prising
                    promptitude.&#x201D;&#x2014;The medica-<lb/>ment consisted of an infusion of a
                    shrub<lb/>called <hi rendition="#i">uzao</hi>.</p>
                <p>The annexed notice of the religious<lb/>opinions of the natives has
                    something<lb/>very sublime in it:&#x2014;&#x201C;The nations of<lb/>the Upper
                    Oroonoko, the Atabapo, and<lb/>the Inirida, like the ancient Germans<lb/>
                    <pb n="471" facs="#f0013"/>
                    <cb/>and the Persians, have no other wor-<lb/>ship than that of the powers of
                    nature.<lb/>They call the good principle <hi rendition="#i"
                    >Cachima-<lb/>na</hi>; it is the <hi rendition="#i">Manitou</hi>, the Great
                    Spirit,<lb/>that regulates the seasons, and favours<lb/>the harvests. Along with
                        <hi rendition="#i">Cachima-<lb/>na</hi> there is an evil principle, <hi
                        rendition="#i">Iolokiamo</hi>,<lb/>less powerful, but more artful, and
                    in<lb/>particular more active. The Indians<lb/>of the forest, when they visit
                    occasional-<lb/>ly the missions, conceive with difficulty<lb/>the idea of a
                    temple or an image. &#x201C;These<lb/>good people,&#x201D; said the
                    missionary,<lb/>&#x201C;like only processions in the open air.<lb/>When I last
                    celebrated the patron fes-<lb/>tival of my village, that of San Anto-<lb/>nio,
                    the Indians of Inirida were pre-<lb/>sent at mass. &#x2018;Your God,&#x2019;
                    said they<lb/>to me, &#x2018;keeps himself shut up in a<lb/>house, as if he were

                    </choice>on the mountains of Sipapu,<lb/>whence the rains come.&#x2019;&#x201D;
                    Among the<lb/>more numerous, and on this account<lb/>less barbarous tribes,
                    religious societies<lb/>of a singular kind are formed. Some<lb/>old Indians
                    pretend to be better in-<lb/>structed than others in what regards
                    the<lb/>divinity; and to them is confided the<lb/>famous <hi rendition="#i"
                        >botuto</hi>, of which I have spoken,<lb/>and which is sounded under the
                        palm-<lb break="hyph-yes"/>trees that they may bear abundance of<lb/>fruit.
                    On the banks of the Oroonoko<lb/>there exists no idol, as among all
                    the<lb/>nations who have remained faithful to<lb/>the first worship of nature,
                    but the<lb/><hi rendition="#i">botuto</hi>, the sacred trumpet, is
                    become<lb/><cb/>an object of veneration. To be initia-<lb/>ted into the
                    mysteries of the <hi rendition="#i">botuto</hi>, it<lb/>is requisite to be of
                    pure manners, and<lb/>to have lived single. The initiated are<lb/>subjected to
                    flagellations, fastings, and<lb/>other painful exercises. There are but<lb/>a
                    small number of these sacred trum-<lb/>pets. The most anciently
                    celebrated<lb/>is that upon a hill near the confluence<lb/>of the Tomo and the
                    Guainia. It is<lb/>pretended, that it is heard at once on<lb/>the banks of the
                    Tuamini, and at the<lb/>mission of San Miguel de Davipe, a<lb/>distance of ten
                    leagues. Father Cere-<lb/>so assured us, that the Indians speak<lb/>of the <hi
                        rendition="#i">botuto</hi> of Tomo as an object of<lb/> worship common to
                    many surrounding<lb/>tribes. Fruit and intoxicating liquors<lb/>are placed
                    beside the sacred trumpet.<lb/>Sometimes the Great Spirit <hi rendition="#i"
                        >(Cachi-<lb/>mana)</hi> himself makes the <hi rendition="#i">botuto</hi>
                    re-<lb/>sound; sometimes he is content to<lb/>manifest his will by him, to whom
                    the<lb/>keeping of the instrument is entrusted.<lb/>These juggleries being very
                    ancient<lb/>(from the fathers of our fathers, say<lb/>the Indians), we must not
                    be surprised,<lb/>that some incredulous are already to be<lb/>found; but they
                    express their disbe-<lb/>lief of the <hi rendition="#i">botuto</hi> only in
                    whispers.<lb/>Women are not permitted to see this<lb/>marvellous instrument; and
                    are exclud-<lb/>ed from all the ceremonies of this wor-<lb/>ship. If a woman
                    have the misfor-<lb/>tune to see the trumpet, she is put to <lb/>death without
                    mercy.&#x201D;</p>

                    less enthusiastic, less gifted individuals.<lb/>Such is Humboldt, every addition
                    to whose travels is an addition to our stock of knowl-<lb/>edge. In him all the
                    qualities that are requisite for a philosopher and a man of science<lb/>are most
                    happily combined, whilst the energies of his mind seem to transform
                    them-<lb/>selves into physical powers of more natural strength, to enable him to
                    follow whither<lb/>his ardour leads him. The termination of his &#x201C;Personal
                    Narrative&#x201D; has made its ap-<lb/>pearance, and the last part is no way
                    inferior to the first, in vigour of research, truth of<lb/>inference, and beauty
                    of moral reflection. It is not easy for persons who stay quietly<lb/>at home, to
                    imagine the exceeding energy of mind which must be called up to bear
                    the<lb/>privations, the perplexities, of a man exposed to every variation of
                    climate, and to pe-<lb/>culiarities attendant on each, of which he may be
                    totally ignorant, <hi rendition="#i">N.M.M.</hi></p>

                    valuable labours of<lb/>M. Humboldt appeared, we paid it<lb/>that immediate
                    attention which a work<lb/>so replete with information demanded;<lb/>and having
                    conducted our readers<lb/>through one of the two 8vo. vols into<lb/>which it is

                <p>Without retracing, to connect our<lb/>statements, we will beg our readers
                    to<lb/>plant themselves at Esmeralda, on the<lb/>Upper Oroonoko the most
                    solitary and<lb/>remote Christian settlement in those<lb/>regions. Here there is
                    a bifurcation<lb/>of the river, and the granitic mountain<lb/>of Duida rises to
                    the height of nearly<lb/>8000 feet. The mission contains about<lb/>eighty
                    inhabitants, and yet no fewer<lb/>than three Indian languages are

                <p>&#x201C;Esmeralda, (says M.H.) is the<lb/>most celebrated spot on the
                    Oroonoko<lb/>for the fabrication of that active poison<lb/>which is employed in
                    war, in the chase,<lb/>and, what is singular enough, as a<lb/><pb n="133"

                    known. Raleigh,<lb/>toward the end of the sixteenth centu-<lb/>ry, had heard the

                    as-<lb/>serts that &#x2018;this preparation was in-<lb/>veloped in great
                    mystery; that its<lb/>principal ingredient was furnished by<lb/>a subterraneous
                    plant, by a tuberose<lb/>root, which never puts forth leaves,<lb/>and which is
                    called the root, by way<lb/>of eminence, <hi rendition="#i">raiz de si

                    with them,<lb/>the poison is judged to be sufficiently<lb/>concentrated.&#x2019;
                    I shall not stop to re-<lb/>fute these popular tales collected by<lb/>Father
                    Gumilla.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;When we (he continues) arrived<lb/>at Esmeralda, the greater part of
                    the<lb/>Indians were returning from an ex-<lb/>cursion which they had made to
                    the east<lb/>beyond the Rio Padamo, to gather<lb/><hi rendition="#i"
                    >juvias</hi>, or the fruit of the bertholletia,<lb/>and the liana which yields
                    the curare.<lb/>Their return was celebrated by a festi-<lb/>val, which is called
                    in the mission <hi rendition="#i">la<lb/>fiesta de las juvias</hi>, and which
                    resem-<lb/>bles our harvest homes and vintage<lb/>feasts. The women had prepared
                    a<lb/>quantity of fermented liquor, and dur-<lb/>ing two days the Indians were
                    in a<lb/>state of intoxication. Among nations<lb/>that attach great importance
                    to the<lb/>fruits of the palm-trees and of some<lb/>others useful for the
                    nourishment of<lb/>man, the period when these fruits are<lb/><cb/> gathered is
                    marked by public rejoicings,<lb/>and time is divided according to
                    these<lb/>festivals, which succeed one another in<lb/>a course invariably the
                    same. We<lb/>were fortunate enough to find an old<lb/>Indian less drunk than the
                    rest, who<lb/>was employed in preparing the <hi rendition="#i"
                    >curare</hi><lb/>poison from freshly-gathered plants.<lb/>He was the chemist of
                    the place. We<lb/>found at his dwelling large earthen pots<lb/>for boiling
                    vegetable juice, shal-<lb/>lower vessels to favour the evaporation<lb/>by a
                    larger surface, and leaves of the<lb/>plantain-tree rolled up in the shape
                    of<lb/>our filters, and used to filtrate the li-<lb/>quors more or less loaded
                    with fibrous<lb/>matter. The greatest order and neat-<lb/>ness prevailed in this
                    hut, which was<lb/>transformed into a chemical laboratory.<lb/>The Indian who
                    was to instruct us, is<lb/>known throughout the mission by the<lb/>name of the
                        <hi rendition="#i">master of poison</hi> (<hi rendition="#i">amo<lb/>del
                        curare;</hi>) he had that self-sufficient<lb/>air and tone of pedantry, of
                    which the<lb/>pharmacopolists of Europe were for-<lb/>merly accused. &#x2018;I
                    know,&#x2019; said he,<lb/>&#x2018;that the whites have the secret
                    of<lb/>fabricating soap, and that black pow-<lb/>der which has the effect of
                    making a<lb/>noise, and killing animals, when they<lb/>are wanted. The <hi
                        rendition="#i">curare</hi>, which we<lb/>prepare from father to son, is
                    superior<lb/>to any thing you can make <hi rendition="#i">down
                    yon-<lb/>der</hi>(beyond sea.) It is the juice of an<lb/>herb which <hi
                        rendition="#i">kills silently</hi>, without any<lb/>one knowing whence the
                    stroke<lb/>comes.&#x2019;</p>
                <p>&#x201C;This chemical operation, to which<lb/>the <hi rendition="#i">master of
                        the curare</hi> attached so<lb/>much importance, appears to us
                    ex-<lb/>tremely simple. The liana (<hi rendition="#i">bujuco</hi>,)<lb/>which is
                    used at Esmeralda for the<lb/>preparation of the poison, bears the<lb/>same name
                    as in the forest of Javita.<lb/>It is the <hi rendition="#i">bejuco de
                        mavacure</hi>, which is<lb/>gathered in abundance east of the mis-<lb/>sion,
                    on the left bank of the Oroonoko,<lb/>beyond the Rio Amaguaca, in
                    the<lb/>mountains and granitic lands of<lb/>Guanaya and Yumariquin.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The juice of the liana, when it has<lb/>been recently gathered, is not
                    regarded<lb/>as poisonous; perhaps it acts in a sen-<lb/>sible manner only when
                    it is strongly<lb/>concentrated. It is the bark, and a<lb/>part of the alburnum,
                    which contains<lb/>this terrible poison.&#x2014;Branches of the<lb/><pb n="134"

                    diameter,<lb/>are scraped with a knife; and the bark<lb/>that comes off is
                    bruised, and reduced<lb/>into very thin filaments, on the stone<lb/>employed for
                    grinding cassava. The<lb/>venomous juice being yellow, the whole<lb/>fibrous
                    mass takes this colour. It is<lb/>thrown into a funnel nine inches
                    high,<lb/>with an opening four inches wide.<lb/>This funnel was, of all the
                    instruments<lb/>of the Indian laboratory, that of which<lb/>the <hi
                        rendition="#i">master of poison</hi> seemed to be<lb/>most proud. He asked
                    us repeatedly,<lb/>if <hi rendition="#i">por allà</hi> (<hi rendition="#i">down
                        yonder,</hi> that is in<lb/>Europe) we had ever seen any thing<lb/>to be
                    compared to his <hi rendition="#i">empudo.</hi> It<lb/>was a leaf of a
                    plantain-tree rolled<lb/>up in the form of a cone, and placed<lb/>in another
                    stronger cone made of the<lb/>leaves of the palm-tree. The whole<lb/>of this
                    apparatus was supported by<lb/>slight frame work made of the petioli<lb/>and
                    ribs of palm-leaves. A cold infu-<lb/>sion is first prepared by pouring
                    water<lb/>on the fibrous matter, which is the<lb/>ground bark of the <hi
                        rendition="#i">mavacure.</hi> A yel-<lb/>lowish water filters during
                    several<lb/>hours, drop by drop, through the leafy<lb/>funnel. This filtered
                    water is the ve-<lb/>nomous liquor, but it acquires strength<lb/>only when it is
                    concentrated by evapo-<lb/>ration, like molasses in a large earthen<lb/>pot. The
                    Indian from time to time<lb/>invited us to taste the liquid; its taste,<lb/>more
                    or less bitter, decides when the<lb/>concentration by fire has been
                    carried<lb/>sufficiently far. There is no danger in<lb/>this operation, the <hi
                        rendition="#i">curare</hi> being dele-<lb/>terious only when it comes into
                    imme-<lb/>diate contact with the blood. The<lb/>vapours, therefore, that are
                    disengaged<lb/>from the pans, are not hurtful, notwith-<lb/>standing what has
                    been asserted on this<lb/>point by the Missionaries of the Oroo-<lb/>noko.
                    Fontana, in his fine experi-<lb/>ments on the poison of the <hi rendition="#i"
                        >ticunas</hi> of<lb/>the river of Amazons, long ago proved,<lb/>that the
                    vapours arising from this poi-<lb/>son when thrown on burning charcoal,<lb/>may
                    be inhaled without apprehension;<lb/>and that it is false, as M. de la
                    Conda-<lb/>mine has announced, that Indian wo-<lb/>men, when condemned to death,
                    have<lb/>been killed by the vapours of the poi-<lb/>son of the <hi
                        rendition="#i">ticunas</hi>.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>The juice is thickened with a gluti-<lb/>nous substance to cause it to stick
                    to<lb/><cb/>the darts, which it renders mortal; but<lb/>taken internally, the
                    Indians consider<lb/>the <hi rendition="#i">curare</hi> to be an excellent
                    stomachic.<lb/>&#x201C;Scarcely a fowl is eaten (adds our<lb/>author,) on the
                    banks of the Oroonoko,<lb/>which has not been killed with a poi-<lb/>soned
                    arrow. The Missionaries pre-<lb/>tend, that the flesh of animals is never<lb/>so
                    good as when these means are em-<lb/>ployed. Father Zea, who accompa-<lb/>nied
                    us, though ill of a tertian fever,<lb/>caused every morning the live fowl
                    al-<lb/>lotted for our repast to be brought to<lb/>his hammock, together with an
                    arrow.<lb/>Notwithstanding his habitual state of<lb/>weakness, he would not
                    confide this<lb/>operation, to which he attached great<lb/>importance, to any
                    other person.&#x2014;<lb/>Large birds, a guan (<hi rendition="#i">pava de
                        monte</hi>)<lb/>for instance, or a curassoa (<hi rendition="#i"
                    >alsetor</hi>,)<lb/>when wounded in the thigh, perish in<lb/>two or three
                    minutes; but it is often<lb/>ten or twelve before a pig or a
                    pecari<lb/>expires.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>M. Humboldt does not seem to be<lb/>acquainted with any certain antidote,<lb/>if
                    such exists, to this fatal poison. Su-<lb/>gar, garlic, the muriate of soda,
                    &amp;c.<lb/>are mentioned doubtingly. In Lon-<lb/>don some very curious
                    experiments<lb/>were tried on animals somewhat re-<lb/>sembling those used to
                    restore suspend-<lb/>ed animation by drowning. By keep-<lb/>ing up a constant
                    motion of the lungs<lb/>by inflation with bellows and expira-<lb/>tion through
                    pressure for many hours,<lb/>it was supposed that the creature appa-<lb/>rently
                    killed by the curare would re-<lb/>vive: we are not informed whether<lb/>the
                    operation ever succeeded but we<lb/>believe that several dead horses
                    and<lb/>asses refused to come to life again!<lb/>But to return to the narrative. </p>
                <p>&#x201C;The old Indian, who was called<lb/>the <hi rendition="#i">master of
                        poison</hi>, seemed flattered<lb/>by the interest we had taken in
                    his<lb/>chemical processes. He found us suf-<lb/>ficiently intelligent to have
                    no doubt<lb/>that we knew how to make soap, and,<lb/>next to the preparation of
                        <hi rendition="#i">curare</hi>, this<lb/>art appeared to him one of the
                    finest<lb/>of inventions of the human mind. When<lb/>the liquid poison was
                    poured into the<lb/>vessels prepared for their purpose, we<lb/>accompanied the
                    Indian to the <hi rendition="#i">festival<lb/>of the juvias</hi>. The harvest of
                        <hi rendition="#i">juvias</hi>,<lb/>or fruits of the <hi rendition="#i"
                        >bertholletia excelsa</hi>,<lb/><pb n="135" facs="#f0017"/><cb/>was
                    celebrated by dancing, and by ex-<lb/>cesses of the most wild
                    intoxication.<lb/>The hut, where the natives were as-<lb/>sembled, displayed,
                    during several days,<lb/>a very singular aspect. There was<lb/>neither table nor
                    bench, but large roast-<lb/>ed monkeys, blackened by smoke,<lb/>were ranged in
                    order, resting against<lb/>the wall. These were the <hi rendition="#i"
                        >marimon-<lb/>des</hi> (ateles belzebuth), and those beard-<lb/>ed monkeys
                    called <hi rendition="#i">capuchins</hi>, which<lb/>must not be confounded with
                    the weep-<lb/>er, or sai (simia capucina of Buffon.)<lb/>The manner of roasting
                    these anthro-<lb/>pomorphous animals contributes singu-<lb/>larly to render
                    their appearance disa-<lb/>greeable in the eyes of civilized man.<lb/>A little
                    grating or lattice of very hard<lb/>wood is formed, and raised one foot<lb/>from
                    the ground. The monkey is<lb/>skinned, and bent into a sitting pos-<lb/>ture;
                    the head generally resting on<lb/>the arms, which are meagre and long;<lb/>but
                    sometimes these are crossed be-<lb/>hind the back. When it is tied on
                    the<lb/>grating, a very clear fire is kindled be-<lb/>low. The monkey, enveloped
                    in smoke<lb/>and flame, is broiled and blackened at<lb/>the same time. On seeing
                    the natives<lb/>devour the arm or leg of a roasted<lb/>monkey, it is difficult
                    not to believe,<lb/>that this habit of eating animals, that<lb/>so much resemble
                    man in their physi-<lb/>cal organization, has, to a certain de-<lb/>gree,
                    contributed to diminish the hor-<lb/>ror of anthropophagy among
                    savages.<lb/>Roasted monkeys, particularly those<lb/>which have a very round
                    head, display a<lb/>hideous resemblance to a child; the<lb/>Europeans therefore,
                    who are obliged<lb/>to feed on quadrumanes, prefer sepa-<lb/>rating the head and
                    the hands, and<lb/>serve up only the rest of the animal<lb/>at their tables. The
                    flesh of monkeys is<lb/>so lean and dry, that M. Bonpland has<lb/>preserved in
                    his collections at Paris an<lb/>arm and hand, which had been broiled<lb/>over
                    the fire at Esmeralda; and no<lb/>smell has arisen from them after a
                    great<lb/>number of years.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;We saw the Indians dance. The<lb/>monotony of their dancing is increased
                    by<lb/>the women not daring to take part in<lb/>it. The men, young and old, form
                    a<lb/>circle, holding each other&#x2019;s hands, and<lb/>turn sometimes to the
                    right, some-<lb/>times to the left, for whole hours, with<lb/><cb/>silent
                    gravity. Most frequently the<lb/>dancers themselves are the
                    musicians.<lb/>Feeble sounds, drawn from a series of<lb/>reeds of different
                    lengths, form a slow<lb/>and plaintive accompaniment. The<lb/>first dancer, to
                    mark the time, bends<lb/>both knees in a kind of cadence.&#x2014;<lb/>Sometimes
                    they all make a pause in<lb/>their places, and execute little oscilla-<lb/>tory
                    movements, bending the body<lb/>from one side to the other. These<lb/>reeds,
                    ranged in a line, and fastened<lb/>together, resemble the pipe of Pan, as<lb/>we
                    find it represented in the bacchana-<lb/>lian processions on Grecian vases.
                    To<lb/>unite reeds of different lengths, and<lb/>make them sound in succession
                    by<lb/>passing them before the lips, is a sim-<lb/>ple idea, and has naturally
                    presented itself<lb/>to every nation. We were surprised<lb/>to see with what
                    promptitude the young<lb/>Indians constructed and tuned these<lb/>pipes, when
                    they found reeds (<hi rendition="#i">carices</hi>)<lb/>on the bank of the river.
                    Men, in a<lb/>state of nature, in every zone, make<lb/>great use of these
                    gramina with high<lb/>stalks. The Greeks said with truth,<lb/>that reeds had
                    contributed to subjugate<lb/>nations by furnishing arrows, to
                    soften<lb/>men&#x2019;s manners by the charm of mu-<lb/>sic, and to unfold their
                    understanding<lb/>by affording the first instruments for<lb/>tracing letters.
                    These different uses<lb/>of reeds mark in some sort three differ-<lb/>ent
                    periods in the life of nations. We<lb/>must admit, that the tribes of the
                    Oroo-<lb/>noko are found in the first step of<lb/>dawning civilization. The reed
                    serves<lb/>them only as an instrument of war and<lb/>of hunting; and the
                    Pan&#x2019;s pipes, of<lb/>which we have spoken, have not yet,<lb/>on those
                    distant shores, yielded sounds<lb/>capable of awakening mild and
                    humane<lb/>feelings.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>Mr. H. gives an interesting account<lb/>of the Juvia, (chesnut-trees,) the
                    har-<lb/>vested fruits of which cause the natives<lb/>to rejoice so much; but
                    there is anoth-<lb/>er tree, the character of which is still<lb/>more curious.
                    It is thus described:&#x2014;</p>
                <p>&#x201C;We saw on the slope of the Cerra<lb/>Duida <hi rendition="#i">shirt
                        trees</hi> fifty feet high. The<lb/>Indians cut off cylindrical pieces
                    two<lb/>feet in diameter, from which they peel<lb/>the red and fibrous bark,
                    without mak-<lb/>ing any longitudinal incision. This<lb/>bark affords them a
                    sort of garment,<lb/><pb n="136" facs="#f0018"/><cb/>which resembles sacks of a
                    very coarse<lb/>texture, and without a seam. The<lb/>upper opening serves for
                    the head:<lb/>and two lateral holes are cut to admit<lb/>the arms. The natives
                    wear these<lb/>shirts of marima in the rainy season:<lb/>they have the form of
                    the <hi rendition="#i">ponchos</hi> and<lb/><hi rendition="#i">ruanas</hi> of
                    cotton, which are so com-<lb/>mon in New Grenada, at Quito, and in<lb/>Peru. As
                    in these climates the riches<lb/>and beneficence of nature are regard-<lb/>ed as
                    the primary causes of the indo-<lb/>lence of the inhabitants, the
                    missiona-<lb/>ries do not fail to say, in showing<lb/>the shirts of <hi
                        rendition="#i">marima,</hi> &#x2018;in the forests of the<lb/>Oroonoko,
                    garments are found ready<lb/>made on the trees.&#x2019; We may add to<lb/>this
                    tale of the shirts the pointed caps,<lb/>which the spathes of certain
                    palm-trees<lb/>furnish, and which resemble coarse<lb/>net-work.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;At the festival of which we were<lb/>the spectators, the women were
                    excluded<lb/>from the dance, and every sort of pub-<lb/>lic rejoicing; they were
                    daily occupied<lb/>in serving the men with roasted mon-<lb/>key, fermented
                    liquors, and palm<lb/><cb/>cabbage. I mention this last produc-<lb/>tion, which
                    has the taste of our cauli-<lb/>flowers, because in no other country<lb/>had we
                    seen specimens of such an im-<lb/>mense size. The leaves that are
                    not<lb/>unfolded are <choice>

                    long and five inches in<lb/>diameter. Another substance, which<lb/>is much more
                    nutritive, is obtained<lb/>from the animal kingdom: this is <hi rendition="#i"
                        >fish<lb/>flour</hi>. The Indians in all the Upper<lb/>Oroonoko fry fish,
                    dry them in the sun,<lb/>and reduce them to powder without<lb/>separating the
                    bones. I have seen<lb/>masses of fifty or sixty pounds of this<lb/>flour, which
                    resembles that of cassava.<lb/>When it is wanted for eating, it is mix-<lb/>ed
                    with water, and reduced to a paste.<lb/>In every climate the abundance of
                    fish<lb/>has led to the invention of the same<lb/>means of preserving them.
                    Pliny and<lb/>Diodorus Siculus have described the<lb/><hi rendition="#i">fish

                    who<lb/>consider them as barbarians, have a<lb/>common saying, &#x2018;nothing
                    is so disgust-<lb/>ing that an Otomac will not eat it.&#x2019;<lb/>While the
                    waters of the Oroonoko and<lb/>its tributary streams are low, the Oto-<lb/>macs
                    subsist on fish and turtles. The<lb/>former they kill with surprising
                    dexter-<lb/>ity, by shooting them with an arrow,<lb/>when they appear at the
                    surface of the<lb/>water. When the rivers swell, which<lb/>in South America as
                    well as in Egypt<lb/>and in Nubia, is erroneously attributed<lb/>to the melting
                    of the snows, and which<lb/>occurs periodically in every part of the<lb/>torrid
                    zone, fishing almost entirely<lb/>ceases. It is then as difficult to
                    pro-<lb/>cure fish in the rivers which are be-<lb/>come deeper, as when you are
                    sailing<lb/><cb/> on the open sea. It often fails the poor<lb/>missionaries, on
                    fast-days as well as<lb/>flesh days, though all the young Indians<lb/>are under
                    the obligation of &#x2018;fishing for<lb/>the convent.&#x2019; At the period of
                    these<lb/>inundations, which lasts two or three<lb/>months, the Otomacs swallow
                    a prodi-<lb/>gious quantity of earth. We found<lb/>heaps of balls in their huts,
                    piled up in<lb/>pyramids three or four feet high. These<lb/>balls were five or
                    six inches in diame-<lb/>ter. The earth which the Otomacs eat<lb/>is a very fine
                    and unctuous clay, of a<lb/>yellowish grey colour; and, being slight-<lb/>ly
                    baked in the fire, the hardened crust<lb/>has a tint inclining to red, owing to
                    the<lb/>oxid of iron which is mingled with it.<lb/>We brought away some of this
                    earth,<lb/>which we took from the winter provis-<lb/>ion of the Indians; and it
                    is absolutely<lb/>false, that it is steatitic, and contains<lb/>magnesia. Mr.
                    Vauquelin did not dis-<lb/>cover any traces of this earth in it; but<lb/>he
                    found that it contained more silex than<lb/>alumin, and three or four per cent
                    of lime.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The Otomacs do not eat every<lb/>kind of clay indifferently; they
                    choose<lb/>the alluvial beds or strata that contain<lb/>the most unctuous earth,
                    and the<lb/>smoothest to the feel. I inquired of<lb/>the missionary, whether the
                    moistened<lb/>clay were made to undergo, as Father<lb/><pb n="199" facs="#f0020"
                    /><cb/>Gumilla asserts, that peculiar decom-<lb/>position, which is indicated by
                    a dis-<lb/>engagement of carbonic acid and sul-<lb/>phuretted hydrogen, and
                    which is de-<lb/>signated in every language by the<lb/>term of <hi
                        rendition="#i">putrefaction</hi>; but he assured<lb/>us, that the natives
                    neither cause the<lb/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">clay</hi> to <hi rendition="#i">rot</hi>, nor do they mingle
                    it with<lb/>flour of maize, oil of turtles&#x2019; eggs, or fat<lb/>of the
                    crocodile. We ourselves exam-<lb/>ined, both at the Oroonoko and after our<lb/>
                    return to Paris, the balls of earth which<lb/>we brought away with us, and
                    found<lb/>no trace of the mixture of any organic<lb/>substance, whether oily or
                    farinaceous.<lb/>The savage regards every thing as nour-<lb/>ishing that
                    appeases hunger; when,<lb/>therefore, you inquire of an Otomac on<lb/>what he
                    subsists during the two months<lb/>when the river is the highest, he shows<lb/>
                    you his balls of clayey earth. This he<lb/>calls his principal food; for all
                    this pe-<lb/>riod he can seldom procure a lizard, a<lb/>root of fern, or a dead
                    fish swimming at<lb/>the surface of the water. If the Indian<lb/>eat earth from
                    want during two months,<lb/>(and from three quarters to five quar-<lb/>ters of a
                    pound in twenty-four hours,)<lb/>he does not the less regale himself with<lb/>it
                    during the rest of the year. Every<lb/>day in the season of drought, when
                    fish-<lb/>ing is most abundant, he scrapes his<lb/>balls of <hi rendition="#i"
                        >poya,</hi> and mingles a little clay<lb/>with his other aliment. What is
                    most<lb/>surprising is, that the Otomacs do not<lb/>become lean by swallowing
                    such quan-<lb/>tities of earth; they are, on the contrar-<lb/>y, extremely
                    robust, and far from hav-<lb/>ing the belly tense and puffed up.
                    The<lb/>missionary Fray Ramon Bueno asserts,<lb/>that he never remarked any
                    alteration<lb/>in the health of the natives at the peri-<lb/>od of the great
                    risings of the Oroonoko.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The following are the facts in all<lb/>their simplicity, which we were
                    able to<lb/>verify. The Otomacs during some<lb/>months, eat daily three quarters
                    of a<lb/>pound of clay slightly hardened by fire,<lb/>without their health being
                    materially<lb/>affected by it. They moisten the earth<lb/>afresh when they are
                    going to swallow<lb/>it. It has not been possible to verify<lb/>hitherto with
                    precision how much nu-<lb/>tritious vegetable or animal matter the<lb/>Indians
                    take in a week at the same<lb/>time; but it is certain that they attri-<lb/>bute
                    the sensation of satiety which they<lb/><cb/>feel, to the clay, and not to the
                    wretch-<lb/>ed aliments which they take with it<lb/>occasionally. No
                    physiological phe-<lb/>nomenon being entirely insulated, it<lb/>may be
                    interesting to examine several<lb/>analogous phenomena, which I have<lb/>been
                    able to collect.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;I observed every where within the<lb/>torrid zone, in a great number of
                    indi-<lb/>viduals, children, women, and some-<lb/>times even full-grown men, an
                    inordi-<lb/>nate and almost irresistible desire of<lb/>swallowing earth; not an
                    alkaline or<lb/>calcareous earth, to neutralize (as it is<lb/>vulgarly said)
                    acid juices, but a fat clay,<lb/>unctuous, and exhaling a strong smell.<lb/>It
                    is often found necessary to tie the<lb/>children&#x2019;s hands, or to confine
                    them, to<lb/>prevent their eating earth when the rain<lb/>ceases to fall. At the
                    village of Banco,<lb/>on the bank of the river Magdalena, I<lb/>saw the Indian
                    women who make pot-<lb/>tery continually swallowing great pieces<lb/>of
                    clay.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>The author goes at some length into<lb/>analogies and reasoning on them,
                    but<lb/>we confine our quotation principally to<lb/>the facts.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The negroes on the coast of Guinea<lb/>delight in eating a yellowish

                    &#x2018;The red-<lb/>dish and somewhat ferruginous clay,&#x2019;<lb/>he says,
                    &#x2018;which the inhabitants of Java<lb/>are fond of eating occasionally is
                    spread<lb/>on a plate of iron, and baked, after<lb/><pb n="200" facs="#f0021"
                    /><cb/>having been rolled into little cylinders<lb/>in the form of the bark of
                    cinnamon.<lb/>In this state it takes the name of <hi rendition="#i"
                    >ampo,</hi><lb/>and is sold in the public markets. This<lb/>clay has a peculiar
                    taste, which is owing<lb/>to the torrefaction; it is very absorbent,<lb/>and
                    adheres to the tongue, which it<lb/>dries. In general it is only the
                    Java-<lb/>nese women who eat the <hi rendition="#i">ampo,</hi> either<lb/>in the
                    time of their pregnancy, or in<lb/>order to grow thin; the want of
                    plump-<lb/>ness being a kind of beauty in this<lb/>country. The use of this
                    earth is fatal<lb/>to health; the women lose their appe-<lb/>tite imperceptibly,
                    and no longer take<lb/>without disgust a very small quantity<lb/>of food: but
                    the desire of becoming<lb/>lean, and of preserving a slender shape,<lb/>can
                    brave these dangers, and maintains<lb/>the credit of the <hi rendition="#i"
                        >ampo.</hi>&#x2019; The savage<lb/>inhabitants of New Caledonia also,
                    to<lb/>appease their hunger in times of scar-<lb/>city, eat great pieces of a
                    friable <hi rendition="#i">lapis<lb/>ollaris.</hi> Mr. Vauquelin analysed
                    this<lb/>stone, and found in it, beside magnesia<lb/>and silex in equal
                    portions, a small<lb/>quantity of oxid of copper. Mr. Gold-<lb/>berry had seen
                    the negroes in Africa,<lb/>in the islands of Bunck and Los Idolos,<lb/>eat an
                    earth of which he had himself<lb/>eaten, without being incommoded by it,<lb/>and
                    which also was a white and friable<lb/>steatite.&#x201D; * * * * *</p>
                <cb/>
                <p>&#x201C;When we reflect on the whole of<lb/>these facts, we perceive that this
                    disor-<lb/>derly appetite for clayey, magnesian,<lb/>and calcareous earth, is
                    most common<lb/>among the people of the torrid zone;<lb/>that it is not always a
                    cause of disease;<lb/>and that some tribes eat earth from<lb/>choice, while
                    others (the Otomacs in<lb/>America, and the inhabitants of New<lb/>Caledonia, in
                    the Pacific Ocean,) eat it<lb/>from want, and to appease hunger.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The observations, which I made on<lb/>the banks of the <choice>

                        <corr type="editorial">Oroonoko</corr>
                    </choice>, have been<lb/>recently confirmed by the direct experi-<lb/>ments of
                    two distinguished young phy-<lb/>siologists, Messrs. Hippolite Cloquet<lb/>and
                    Breschet. After long fasting, they<lb/>ate as much as five ounces of a
                    silvery<lb/>green and very flexible laminar talc.<lb/>Their hunger was
                    completely satisfied,<lb/>and they felt no inconvenience from a<lb/>kind of
                    food, to which their organs were<lb/>unaccustomed. It is known that great<lb/>
                    use is still made in the East of the bolar<lb/>and sigillated earths of Lemnos,
                    which<lb/>are clay mingled with oxid of iron. In<lb/>Germany, the workmen
                    employed in<lb/>the quarries of sandstone worked at the<lb/>mountain of
                    Kiffh&#x00E6;user spread a very<lb/>fine clay upon their bread, instead of

                    of the Oroo-<lb/>noko.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;When the waters (says Mr. H.)<lb/>are high, the river inundates the
                    keys;<lb/>and it sometimes happens, that even in<lb/>the town imprudent men
                    become the<lb/>prey of crocodiles. I shall transcribe<lb/>from my journal a
                    fact, that took place<lb/>during Mr. Bonpland&#x2019;s illness. A<lb/>Guaykeri
                    Indian, from the island de la<lb/>Margaretta, went to anchor his canoe<lb/>in a
                    cove, where there were not three<lb/>feet of water. A very fierce
                    crocodile,<lb/>that habitually haunted that spot, seized<lb/>him by the leg, and
                    withdrew from the<lb/>shore, remaining on the surface of the<lb/>water. The
                    cries of the Indian drew<lb/>together a crowd of spectators.
                    This<lb/>unfortunate man was first seen seeking<lb/>for a knife in the pocket of
                    his panta-<lb/>loons. Not being able to find it, he<lb/>seized the head of the
                    crocodile, and<lb/>thrust his fingers into its eyes. No man<lb/>in the hot
                    regions of America is igno-<lb/>rant, that this carnivorous reptile,
                    cov-<lb/>ered with a buckler of hard and dry<lb/>scales, is extremely sensible
                    in the only<lb/>parts of his body which are soft and un-<lb/>protected, such as
                    the eyes, the hollow<lb/>underneath the shoulders, the nostrils,<lb/>and beneath
                    the lower jaw, where there<lb/>are two glands of musk. The Guay-<lb/>keri Indian
                    had recourse to the same<lb/>means which saved the negro of Mungo<lb/>Park, and
                    the girl of Uritucu, whom I<lb/>have mentioned above; but he was
                    less<lb/>fortunate than they had been, for the<lb/>crocodile did not open its
                    jaws, and lose<lb/>hold of its prey. The animal, yielding<lb/>to the pain,
                    plunged to the bottom of<lb/>the river; and, after having drowned<lb/>the
                    Indian, came up to the surface of<lb/><cb/>the water, dragging the dead body
                    to<lb/>an island opposite the port. I arrived<lb/>at the moment when a great
                    number of<lb/>the inhabitants of Angostura had wit-<lb/>nessed this melancholy
                    spectacle.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;As the crocodile, on account of the<lb/>structure of its larynx, of the
                    hyoid<lb/>bone, and of the folds of its tongue, can<lb/>seize, though not
                    swallow, its prey un-<lb/>der water; a man seldom disappears<lb/>without the
                    animal being perceived<lb/>some hours after near the spot devour-<lb/>ing its
                    prey on a neighbouring beach.<lb/>The number of individuals who perish<lb/>
                    annually, the victims of their own im-<lb/>prudence and of the ferocity of
                    these<lb/>reptiles, is much greater than it is be-<lb/>lieved to be in Europe.
                    It is particu-<lb/>larly so in villages, where the neigh-<lb/>bouring grounds
                    are often inundated.<lb/>The same crocodiles remain long in the<lb/>same places.
                    They become from year<lb/>to year more daring, especially, as the<lb/>Indians
                    assert, if they have once tasted<lb/>of human flesh. These animals are
                    so<lb/>wary, that they are killed with difficulty.<lb/>A ball does not pierce
                    their skin, and<lb/>the shot is only mortal when directed<lb/>at the throat, or
                    beneath the shoulder.</p>
                <p>The Indians, who know little of the<lb/>use of fire-arms, attack the
                    crocodile<lb/>with lances, after it is caught with large<lb/>pointed iron hooks,
                    baited with pieces<lb/>of meat, and fastened by a chain to the<lb/>trunk of a
                    tree. They do not approach<lb/>the animal till it has struggled a long<lb/>time
                    to disengage itself from the iron<lb/>fixed in the upper jaw. There is
                    little<lb/>probability that a country in which a<lb/>labyrinth of rivers without
                    number<lb/>brings every day new bands of croco-<lb/>diles from the eastern back
                    of the An-<lb/>des, by the Meta and the Apure, to-<lb/>wards the coast of
                    Spanish Guyana,<lb/>should ever be delivered from these<lb/>reptiles. All that
                    will be gained by<lb/>civilization will be, to render them more<lb/>timid, and
                    more easily put to flight.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;Affecting instances are related of<lb/>African slaves, who have exposed
                    their<lb/>lives to save those of their masters,<lb/>who had fallen into the jaws
                    of the cro-<lb/><pb n="314" facs="#f0023"/><cb/>codile. A few years ago,
                    between<lb/>Uritucu and the <hi rendition="#i">Mission de Abaxo,</hi> a<lb/>
                    negro, hearing the cries of his master,<lb/>flew to the spot, armed with a
                    long<lb/>knife, (<hi rendition="#i">machette</hi>,) and plunged into
                    the<lb/>river. He forced the crocodile, by<lb/>putting out his eyes, to let go
                    his prey,<lb/>and hide himself under the water. The<lb/>slave bore his expiring
                    master to the<lb/>shore, but all succour was unavailing to<lb/>restore him to
                    life. He died of suffo-<lb/><cb/>cation, for his wounds were not deep;<lb/>the
                    crocodile, like the dog, appears not<lb/>to close its jaws firmly while
                    swimming.<lb/>It is almost superfluous to add, that the<lb/>children of the
                    deceased, though poor,<lb/>gave the slave his freedom.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>Upon the whole, this portion of Mr.<lb/>Humboldt&#x2019;s work is equally
                    entertain-<lb/>ing with what has gone before, and<lb/>throws much light on
                    Physics and Ge-<lb/>ography.</p>
