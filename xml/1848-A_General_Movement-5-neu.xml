In the<lb/>same month in which Hernando Cortes commenced<lb/>his march against Mexico, after the battle of Otum-<lb/>ba, Martin Luther burnt the papal bull at Witten-<lb/>berg, and laid the corner-stone of the Reformation.<lb/>A little earlier the most glorious creations of ancient<lb/>Grecian art, the Laocoon, the Torso, the Apollo<lb/>Belvedere, and the Medicean Venus had risen as it<lb/>were from their graves. Michael Angelo, Leonardo<lb/>da Vinci, Titian, and Raphael, were illustrious in<lb/>Italy; Albert Durer and Holbein in our own Father-<lb/>land. The true system of the universe was discov-<lb/>ered by Copernicus the very year in which Colum-<lb/>bus died, though he did not make it known till some-<lb/>what later.&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rendition="#i">Translation from Humbolt&#x2019;s Kos-<lb/>mos</hi>,&#x201D; vol. ii, p. 338.</p></div><lb/></body><back></back>
