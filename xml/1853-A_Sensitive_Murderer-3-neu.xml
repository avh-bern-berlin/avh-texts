<div n="1"><head>A SENSITIVE MURDERER.</head><lb/><p>It frequently happens (says Humboldt) that sentences of<lb/>death, tardily pronounced by the Audiencia of Caraccas, cannot<lb/>be executed for want of a hangman. In these cases the bar-<lb/>barous custom is observed of pardoning one criminal on condition<lb/>of his hanging the others. Our guides related to us that, a<lb/>short time before our arrival on the coast of Cumana, a Zambo,<lb/>known for the great ferocity of his manners, determined to<lb/>screen himself from punishment by turning executioner. The<lb/>preparations for the execution, however, shook his resolution;<lb/>he felt a horror of himself, and, preferring death to the dis-<lb/>grace of thus saving his life, he called again for his irons, which<lb/>had been struck off. He did not long remain in prison, and he<lb/>underwent his sentence through the baseness of one of his ac-<lb/>complices. This awakening of a sentiment of honour in the<lb/>soul of a murderer is a psychologic phenomenon worthy of re-<lb/>flection. The man who had so often shed the blood of travel-<lb/>lers in the plains, recoiled at the idea of becoming the passive in-<lb/>strument of justice, in inflicting upon others a punishment<lb/>which he felt that he himself deserved.</p></div><lb/></body><back></back>
