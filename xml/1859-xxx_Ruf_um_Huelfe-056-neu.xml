    <p>Baron de Humboldt has addressed the following note<lb/>
        to the Berlin journals:&#x2014;&#x2018;Overwhelmed by the num-<lb/>
        ber of letters sent me, which are increasing every day,<lb/>
        amounting to from 1,600 to 2,000 per annum; many,<lb/>
        too, being on the most futile subjects, such as demands<lb/>
        for my autograph, and offers to cure me of all diseases;<lb/>
        I once more make a public appeal to the persons who<lb/>
        wish me well, and request them not to occupy them-<lb/>
        selves so much with what concerns me, in order that<lb/>
        with the diminution of strength, physical and intel-<lb/>
        lectual, which I experience, I may be allowed a little<lb/>
        leisure for study and composition. I trust that this<lb/>
        step to which I have recourse with reluctance, will not<lb/>
        be interpreted unkindly.&#x201D;</p><lb/></body><back></back>
