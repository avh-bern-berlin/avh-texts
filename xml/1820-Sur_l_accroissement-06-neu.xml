<div n="1"><head>COMPARATIVE INTENSITY OF SOUNDS.</head><lb/><p>The inhabitants of Atures and Maypures, what-<lb/>ever the missionaries may have asserted in their works,<lb/>are not more struck with deafness by the noise of the<lb/>great cataracts, than the Catadupes of the Nile. When<lb/>this noise is heard in the plain that surrounds the<lb/>mission, at the distance of more than a league, you<lb/>seem to be near a coast skirted by reefs and breakers.<lb/>The noise is three times as loud by night as by day,<lb/>and gives an inexpressible charm to these solitary<lb/>scenes. What can be the cause of this increased in-<lb/>tensity of sound in a desert, where nothing seems to<lb/>interrupt the silence of nature? The velocity of the<lb/>propagation of sound, far from augmenting, decreases<lb/>with the lowering of the temperature. The intensity<lb/>diminishes in air, agitated by a wind, which is con-<lb/>trary to the direction of the sound; it diminishes also<lb/>by dilatation of the air, and is weaker in the higher than<lb/>in the lower regions of the atmosphere, where the<lb/>number of particles of air in motion is greater in the<lb/>same radius. The intensity is the same in dry air,<lb/>and in air mingled with vapours; but it is feebler in<lb/><pb n="229" facs="#f0002" />
carbonic acid gas, than in mixtures of azot and oxygen.<lb/>From these facts, which are all we know with any cer-<lb/>tainty, it is difficult to explain a phenomenon observed<lb/>near every cascade in Europe, and which, long before<lb/>our arrival in the village of Atures, had struck the<lb/>missionary and the Indians. The nocturnal tempera-<lb/>ture of the atmosphere is 3° less than the temperature<lb/>of the day; at the same time the apparent humidity<lb/>augments at night, and the mist that covers the cata-<lb/>racts becomes thicker. We have just seen, that the<lb/>hygroscopic state of the air has no influence on the<lb/>propagation of the sound, and that the cooling of the<lb/>air diminishes its swiftness.</p><lb/><p>It may be thought, that, even in places not inhabited<lb/>by man, the hum of insects, the song of birds, the<lb/>rustling of leaves agitated by the feeblest winds, occa-<lb/>sion, during the day, a confused noise, which we per-<lb/>ceive the less because it is uniform, and constantly<lb/>strikes the ear. Now this noise, however slightly<lb/>perceptible it may be, may diminish the intensity of a<lb/>louder noise; and this diminution may cease, if during<lb/>the calm of the night the song of birds, the hum of<lb/>insects, and the action of the wind upon the leaves, be<lb/>interrupted. But this reasoning, even admitting its<lb/>justness, can scarcely be applied to the forests of the<lb/>Oroonoko, where the air is constantly filled by an in-<lb/>numerable quantity of moschettoes, where the hum of<lb/>insects is much louder by night than by day, and<lb/>where the breeze, if ever it be felt, blows only after<lb/>sunset.</p><lb/><p>I rather think, that the presence of the sun acts<lb/>upon the propagation and intensity of the
                    sound by<lb/>the obstacles which they find in the currents of air
                    of<lb/>different density, and the partial undulations of the<lb/>atmosphere
                    caused by the unequal heating of different<lb/>parts of the soil. In calm air,
                    whether it be dry, or<lb/>mingled with vesicular vapours equally
                        distributed,<lb/><pb n="230" facs="#f0003"/> the <hi rendition="#i">sonorous
                        undulation</hi> is propagated without difficulty.<lb/>But when the air is
                    crossed in every direction by<lb/>small currents of hotter air, the sonorous
                    undulation<lb/>is divided into two undulations; where the density of<lb/>the
                    medium changes abruptly, partial echoes are<lb/>formed, that weaken the sound,
                    because one of the<lb/>streams comes back upon itself; and those
                    divisions<lb/>of undulations take place, of which Mr. Poisson has<lb/>recently
                    developed the theory with great sagacity.<lb/>It is not therefore the movement
                    of the particles of<lb/>air from below to above in the ascending current,
                    or<lb/>the small oblique currents, that we consider as oppos-<lb/>ing by a shock
                    the propagation of the sonorous undu-<lb/>lations. A shock, given to the surface
                    of a liquid,<lb/>will form circles around the center of percussion,<lb/>even
                    when the liquid is agitated. Several kinds of<lb/>undulations may cross each
                    other in water, as in air,<lb/>without being disturbed in their propagation;
                    little<lb/>movements may <hi rendition="#i">ride over each other,</hi> and the
                    real cause<lb/>of the less intensity of sound during the day appears to
                    be<lb/>the interruption of homogeneity in the elastic medium.<lb/>During the
                    day, there is a sudden interruption of den-<lb/>sity wherever small streamlets
                    of air of a high tempe-<lb/>rature rise over parts of the soil unequally heated.
                    The<lb/>sonorous undulations are divided, as the rays of light<lb/>are
                    refracted, and form the <hi rendition="#i">mirage</hi> (looming,)
                    wherever<lb/>strata of air of unequal density are contiguous.
                    The<lb/>propagation of sound is altered, when a stratum of hy-<lb/>drogen gas is
                    made to rise in a tube closed at one end<lb/>above a stratum of atmospheric air;
                    and Mr. Biot has<lb/>well explained, by the interposition of bubbles of
                    car-<lb/>bonic acid gas, why a glass filled with Champagne<lb/>wine is little
                    sonorous so long as the gas is evolved,<lb/>and continues to pass through the
                    strata of the liquid.</p><lb/><p><hi rendition="#et"><hi rendition="#i">Humboldt&#x2019;s Personal Narrative.</hi></hi></p></div><lb/></body><back></back>
