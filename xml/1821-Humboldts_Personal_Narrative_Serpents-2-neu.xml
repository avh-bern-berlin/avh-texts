Humboldt relates some rem@kable particulars con-<lb/>cerning the serpents in South America, and the following<lb/>will show to what perils, from them, the traveller is expos-<lb/>ed. On taking up a night&#x2019;s lodging, we are told&#x2014;&#x201C;Before<lb/>we took possession of the deserted @ut, the Indians killed<lb/>two great mapanarc serpents. These grow to four or five<lb/>feet long. They appeared to me to be the same species @<lb/>those I described in the Rio Magdalena. It is a beautiful<lb/>animal, but extremely venomous, white below the belly,<lb/>and spotted with brown and red on the back. As the inside<lb/>of the hut was filled with grass, and as we lay upon the<lb/>ground, there being no means of suspending our hammocks,<lb/>we were not without inquietude during the-night. In the<lb/>morning a large viper was found on lifting up from the<lb/>ground the jaguar skin, upon which one of our domestics<lb/>had slept. The Indians say that these reptiles, slow in their<lb/>movements when they @ not pursued, creep near a man<lb/>because they are fond of heat. In fact, on the banks of the<lb/>Magdalena, @ the bed of one of our f@llow<lb/>traveller@, where he remained a part of the night without<lb/>doing him any harm. Without wishing her@ to take up<lb/>the defen@<lb/>certainly not have resisted their numbers in some parts of<lb/>America; for instance, on the banks of the Oroonoko, and<lb/>the humid mountains of Choco.&#x201D;</p><lb/><p>&#x201C;In the interior part of the New Continent we almost ac-<lb/>customed ourselves to regard men as not being essential to<lb/>the order of nature. The earth is loaded with plants, and<lb/>nothing impedes their free developement. An immense<lb/>layer of mould manifests the uninterrupted action of orga-<lb/>nic powers. The crocodiles and the boas are masters of<lb/>the river; the jaguar, the pecari, the dante, and the<lb/>monkeys, traverse the forest without fear, and without<lb/>danger; there they dwell as in an ancient inheritance. Thi@<lb/>aspect of animated nature, in which man is nothing, has<lb/>something in it strange and sad. To this we reconcile ours<lb/>selves with difficulty on the ocean, and amid the sands o-<lb/>Africa; though in these scenes, where nothing recalls @<lb/>mind our fields, our woods, and our streams, we are leso<lb/>astonished at the vast solitude through which we pass.<lb/>Here, in a fertile country adorned with eternal verdure, we<lb/>seek in vain the traces of the power of man; we seem to be<lb/>transported into a world different from that which gave us<lb/>birth. These impressions are so much the more powerful<lb/>in proportion as they are of longer duration. A soldier, who<lb/>had spent his whole life in the missions of the Upper Oroo-<lb/>noko, slept with us on the bank of the river. He was an<lb/>intelligent man, who, during a calm and serene night, press-<lb/>ed me with questions on the magnitude of the stars, on the<lb/>inhabitants of the moon, on a thousand subjects of which<lb/>I was as ignorant as himself. Being unable, by my answers,<lb/>to satisfy his curiosity, he said to me in a firm tone: &#x2018;With<lb/>respect to men, I believe there are no more above than you<lb/>would have found if you had gone by land from Javita to<lb/>Cassiquaire. I think I see the stars, as here, a plain cover-<lb/>ed with grass, and a forest (mucho monte) traversed by a<lb/>river.&#x2019; In citing these words, I paint the impression pro-<lb/>duced by the monotonous aspect of those solitary regions.&#x201D;</p></div><lb/><milestone unit="section" rendition="#hr"/><lb/>
