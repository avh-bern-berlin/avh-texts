<p>The venerable and venerated Baron Humboldt<lb/>
    has found himself compelled to address the follow-<lb/>
    ing note to the Berlin journals:&#x2014;</p>
    <lb/>
    <p>Overwhelmed by the number of letters sent me, and which<lb/>
        are increasing every day, amounting to from 1,600 to 2,000<lb/>
        per annum&#x2014;many, too, being on the most futile subjects,<lb/>
        such as demands for my autograph, and offers to cure me of<lb/>
        all diseases&#x2014;I once more make a public appeal to the per-<lb/>
        sons who wish me well, and request them not to occupy<lb/>
        themselves so much with what concerns me, in order that<lb/>
        with the diminution of strength, physical and intellectual,<lb/>
        which I experience, I may be allowed a little leisure for<lb/>
        study and composition. I trust that this step, to which I<lb/>
        have recourse with reluctance, will not be interpreted un-<lb/>
        kindly.</p><lb/></body><back></back>
