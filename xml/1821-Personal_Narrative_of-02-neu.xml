          without further<lb break="yes"/>preface, we shall now proceed to<lb break="yes"/>draw for the benefit of our
          readers.</p> 
   
   <p>The natives near the cataracts or<lb break="yes"/>raudales of the Oroonoko, up which<lb break="yes"/>river M. de
          Humboldt made his<lb break="yes"/>way to a height little known to Eu-<lb break="no"/>ropeans, are distinguished
          by seve-<lb break="no"/>ral remarkable prejudices, among<lb break="yes"/>which, none are more fatal than<lb break="yes"/>those narrated in the following:&#x2014;<lb break="yes"/></p>
     
        <p>&#x201C;Among the causes of the depo-<lb break="no"/>pulation of the Raudales, I have
            not<lb break="yes"/>reckoned the small-pox; that malady<lb break="yes"/>which, in other
          parts of America,<lb break="yes"/>makes such cruel ravages, that the<lb break="yes"
          />natives, seized with dismay, burn<lb break="yes"/>their huts, kill their children,
            and<lb break="yes"/>renounce every kind of society.<note place="foot" n="*"><choice>
              <sic>At</sic>
              <corr type="editorial">As</corr>
            </choice> the Mahas, in the plains of the<lb break="yes"/>Missouri, according to the
            accounts of<lb break="yes"/>the American travellers, Clark and<lb break="yes"
            />Lewis.</note>
          <cb/>This scourge is almost unknown on<lb break="yes"/>the banks of the Oronoko. What<lb
            break="yes"/> depopulates the Christian settle-<lb break="no"/>ments is, the repugnance
          of the In-<lb break="no"/>dians for the regulations of the mis-<lb break="no"/>sions, the
          insalubrity of a climate<lb break="yes"/>at once hot and damp, bad nourish-<lb break="no"
          />ment, want of care in the diseases<lb break="yes"/>of children, and the guilty
            practice<lb break="yes"/>of mothers of preventing pregnancy<lb break="yes"/>by the use
          of deleterious herbs.<lb break="yes"/>Among the barbarous people of Guy-<lb break="no"
          />ana, as well as those of the half-<lb break="hyph-yes"/>civilized islands of the South
            Sea,<lb break="yes"/>young wives will not become mo-<lb break="no"/>thers. If they have
          children, their<lb break="yes"/>offspring are exposed, not only to<lb break="yes"/>the
          dangers of savage life, but also<lb break="yes"/>to the dangers arising from the<lb
            break="yes"/>strangest popular prejudices. When<lb break="yes"/>twins are born, false
          notions of pro-<lb break="no"/>priety and family honour require,<lb break="yes"/>that one
          of them should be destroy-<lb/>ed. &#x2018;To bring twins into the world,<lb break="yes"
          />is to be exposed to public scorn; it<lb break="yes"/>is to resemble rats, opossums,
            and<lb break="yes"/>the vilest animals, which bring forth<lb break="yes"/>a great number
          of young at a time.&#x2019;<lb break="yes"/>Nay more: &#x2018;two children born at<lb
            break="yes"/>the same time cannot belong to the<lb break="yes"/>same father.&#x2019;
          This is an axiom of<lb break="yes"/>physiology of the Salivas, and in<lb break="yes"
          />every zone, and in different states<lb break="yes"/>of society, when the vulgar seize<lb
            break="yes"/> upon an axiom, they adhere to it<lb break="yes"/>with more stedfastness
          than the<lb break="yes"/>better informed men, by whom it<lb break="yes"/>was first
          hazarded. To avoid a dis-<lb break="no"/>turbance of conjugal tranquillity,<lb break="yes"
          />the old female relations of the mo-<lb break="no"/>ther, or the <hi rendition="#i">mure
            japoic-nei</hi> (mid-<lb break="no"/>wives,) take care, that one of the<lb break="yes"
          />twins shall disappear. If the new-<lb break="hyph-yes"/>born infant, though not a twin,
            have<lb break="yes"/>any physical deformity, the father<lb break="yes"/>instantly puts
          it to death. They<lb break="yes"/>will have only robust and well-<lb break="hyph-yes"
          />made children, for deformities indi-<lb break="no"/>cate some influence of the evil
            spirit<lb break="yes"/>Ioloquiamo, or the bird <hi rendition="#i">Tikitiki</hi>,<lb
            break="yes"/>the enemy of the human race. Some-<lb break="no"/>times children of a
          feeble constitu-<lb break="no"/>tion undergo the same fate. When<lb break="yes"/>the
          father is asked, what is become<lb break="yes"/>of one of his sons, he will pretend,<lb
            break="yes"/>that he has lost him by a natural<lb break="yes"/>death. He will disavow an
            action,<lb break="yes"/>that appears to him blameable, but<lb break="yes"/>not criminal.
          &#x2018;The poor <hi rendition="#i">mure</hi>,&#x2019;<note place="foot"
            n="*">In Tamanack <hi rendition="#i">mure</hi> signifies a child;<lb break="yes"/>
            <hi rendition="#i">emuru</hi>, a son.</note><lb break="yes"/>he will tell you, &#x2018;could not follow<lb break="yes"

            break="yes"/>where we passed the night.&#x2019; Such<lb break="yes"/>is the candour and
          simplicity of<lb break="yes"/>manners, such the boasted happi-<lb break="no"/>ness of man
          in the <hi rendition="#i">state of nature</hi>!<lb break="yes"/>He kills his son, to
          escape the ridi-<lb break="no"/>cule of having twins, or to avoid<lb break="yes"
          />journeying more slowly; in fact, to<lb break="yes"/>avoid a little
          inconvenience.&#x201D;</p>
   <p>Amid the prodigality and magni-<lb break="no"/>ficence of nature, such are the moral<lb
            break="yes"/>evils which deform the scene; and<lb break="yes"/>we are often compelled to
          leave the<lb break="yes"/>author&#x2019;s glowing descriptions of su-<lb break="no"/>perb
          landscape in the torrid zone,<lb break="yes"/>to vex our spirits with similar de-<lb
            break="no"/>tails. But, the able manner in which<lb break="yes"/>distant objects and
          remote simili-<lb break="no"/>tudes are brought to bear on almost<lb break="yes"/>every
          subject discussed, is the great<lb break="yes"/>charm of this work; and we have so<lb
            break="yes"/>vast a quantity of intelligence com-<lb break="no"/>bined with so rich a
          fund of amusing<lb break="yes"/>anecdote, that the mind never tires.<lb break="yes"/>It
          has been alleged, that Mr. H. is<lb break="yes"/>too prone to this sort of classifica-<lb
            break="no"/>tion, and to theories built upon it;<lb break="yes"/>but however that may be
          in a philo-<lb break="no"/>sophical point of view, as a popular<lb break="yes"
          />performance, it wonderfully en-<lb break="no"/>hances the attractions of his
          narra-<lb/>tive. He is, in truth, the very Jac-<lb break="no"/>ques of travellers; and his
          way is<lb break="yes"/>delectable, &#x201C;compounded of many<lb break="yes"/>simples,
          extracted from many ob-<lb break="no"/>jects; and, indeed, the sundry con-<lb break="no"
          />templation of his travels, in which<lb break="yes"/>his often rumination wraps him in
            a<lb break="yes"/>most humourous sadness.&#x201D; He mo-<lb break="no"/>rals on every
          thing; for example:&#x2014;</p> <p>&#x201C;The inhabitants of Atures and<lb break="yes"/>Maypures, whatever the missiona-<lb
            break="no"/>ries may have asserted in their<lb break="yes"/>works, are not more struck
            with<lb break="yes"/>deafness by the noise of the great<lb break="yes"/>cataracts, than
          the catadupes of the<lb break="yes"/>Nile. When this noise is heard in<lb break="yes"/>the
          plain that surrounds the mis-<lb break="no"/>sion, at the distance of more than a<lb
            break="yes"/>league; you seem to be near a coast<lb break="yes"/>skirted by reefs and
          breakers. The<lb break="yes"/>noise is three times as loud by night<lb break="yes"/>as by
          day, and gives an inexpressi-<lb break="no"/>ble charm to these solitary scenes.<lb
            break="yes"/>What can be the cause of this in-<lb break="no"/>creased intensity of sound
          in a de-<lb break="no"/>sert, where nothing seems to inter-<lb break="no"/>rupt the
          silence of nature? The ve-<lb break="no"/>locity of the propagation of sound,<lb
            break="yes"/>far from augmenting, decreases with<lb break="yes"/>the lowering of the
            temperature.<lb break="yes"/>The intensity diminishes in air,<lb break="yes"/>agitated
          by a wind, which is con-<lb break="no"/>trary to the direction of the sound;<lb
            break="yes"/><cb/>it diminishes also by dilatation of<lb break="yes"/>the air, and is
          weaker in the higher<lb break="yes"/>than in the lower regions of the at-<lb break="no"
          />mosphere, where the number of par-<lb break="no"/>ticles of air in motion is greater
            in<lb break="yes"/>the same radius. The intensity is<lb break="yes"/>the same in dry
          air, and in air min-<lb break="no"/>gled with vapours; but it is feebler<lb break="yes"
          />in carbonic acid gas, than in mix-<lb break="no"/>tures of azot and oxygen. From<lb
            break="yes"/>these facts, which are all we know<lb break="yes"/>with any certainty, it
          is difficult to<lb break="yes"/>explain a phenomenon observed<lb break="yes"/>near every
          cascade in Europe, and<lb break="yes"/>which, long before our arrival in the<lb
            break="yes"/>village of Atures, had struck the<lb break="yes"/>missionary and the
          Indians. The<lb break="yes"/>nocturnal temperature of the atmos-<lb break="no"/>phere is
          3° less than the tempera-<lb break="no"/>ture of the day; at the same time<lb break="yes"
          />the apparent humidity augments at<lb break="yes"/>night, and the mist that covers the<lb
            break="yes"/>cataracts becomes thicker. We<lb break="yes"/>have just seen, that the
            hygroscopic<lb break="yes"/>state of the air has no influence on<lb break="yes"/>the
          propagation of the sound, and<lb break="yes"/>that the cooling of the air dimi-<lb
            break="no"/>nishes its swiftness.</p> <p>&#x201C;It may be thought, that, even in<lb break="yes"/>places not inhabited by man, the<lb break="yes"/>hum of
          insects, the song of birds,<lb break="yes"/>the rustling of leaves agitated by<lb break="yes"/>the feeblest
          winds, occasion, during<lb break="yes"/>the day, a confused noise, which we<lb break="yes"/>perceive the less
          because it is uni-<lb break="no"/>form, and constantly strikes the<lb break="yes"/>ear. Now this noise,
          however<lb break="yes"/>slightly perceptible it may be, may<lb break="yes"/>diminish the intensity of a
          louder,<lb break="yes"/>noise; and this diminution may<lb break="yes"/>cease, if during the calm of the<lb break="yes"/>night the song of birds, the hum of<lb break="yes"/>insects, and the action of the wind<lb break="yes"/>upon the
          leaves, be interrupted. But<lb break="yes"/>this reasoning, even admitting its<lb break="yes"/>justness, can
          scarcely be applied to<lb break="yes"/>the forests of the Oroonoko, where<lb break="yes"/>the air is constantly
          filled by an in-<lb break="no"/>numerable quantity of moschettoes,<lb break="yes"/>where the hum of insects is
          much<lb break="yes"/>louder by night than by day, and<lb break="yes"/>where the breeze, if ever it be felt,<lb break="yes"/>
          blows only after sunset.</p> <p>&#x201C;I rather think, that the presence<lb break="yes"/>of the sun acts upon the
            propagation<lb break="yes"/>and intensity of the sound by the<lb break="yes"/>obstacles
          which they find in the<lb break="yes"/>currents of air different density,<lb break="yes"
          />and the partial undulations of the<lb break="yes"/>atmosphere caused by the unequal<lb
            break="yes"/>heating of different parts of the soil.<lb break="yes"/>In calm air,
          whether it be dry, or<lb break="yes"/>mingled with vesicular vapours<lb break="yes"
          />equally distributed, the <hi rendition="#i">sonorous un-<lb break="no"
            /><cb/>dulation</hi> is propagated without diffi-<lb break="no"/>culty. But when the air
          is crossed<lb break="yes"/>in every direction by small currents<lb break="yes"/>of hotter
          air, the sonorous undula-<lb break="no"/>tion is divided into two undulations,<lb
            break="yes"/>where the density of the medium<lb break="yes"/>changes abruptly, partial
          echoes are<lb break="yes"/>formed, that weaken the sound, be-<lb break="no"/>cause one of
          the streams comes<lb break="yes"/>back upon itself; and those divisions<lb break="yes"/>of
          undulations take place, of which<lb break="yes"/>Mr. Poisson has recently developed<lb
            break="yes"/>the theory with great sagacity. It<lb break="yes"/>is not therefore the
          movement of<lb break="yes"/>the particles of air from below to<lb break="yes"/>above in
          the ascending current, or<lb break="yes"/>the small oblique currents, that we<lb
            break="yes"/>consider as opposing by a shock the<lb break="yes"/>propagation of the
          sonorous undu-<lb break="no"/>lations. A shock, given to the sur-<lb break="no"/>face of a
          liquid, will form circles<lb break="yes"/>around the center of percussion,<lb break="yes"
          />even then the liquid is agitated.<lb break="yes"/>Several kinds of undulations may<lb
            break="yes"/>cross each other in water, as in air,<lb break="yes"/>without being
          disturbed in their pro-<lb break="no"/>pagation; little movements may <hi rendition="#i"
              >ride<lb break="yes"/>over each other</hi>, and the real cause<lb break="yes"/>of the
          less intensity of sound during<lb break="yes"/>the day appears to be the interrup-<lb
            break="no"/>tion of homogeneity in the elastic<lb break="yes"/>medium. During the day,
          there is<lb break="yes"/>a sudden interruption of density,<lb break="yes"/>where ever
          small streamlets of air of<lb break="yes"/>a high temperature rise over parts<lb
            break="yes"/>of the soil unequally heated. The<lb break="yes"/>sonorous undulations are
            divided,<lb break="yes"/>as the rays of light are refracted,<lb break="yes"/>and form
          the <hi rendition="#i">mirage</hi> (looming),<lb break="yes"/>wherever strata of air of
            unequal<lb break="yes"/>density are contiguous. The pro-<lb break="no"/>pagation of
          sound is altered, when<lb break="yes"/>a stratum hydrogen gas is made to<lb break="yes"
          />rise in a tube closed at one end<lb break="yes"/>above a stratum of atmospheric air;<lb
            break="yes"/>and Mr. Biot has well explained, by<lb break="yes"/>the interposition of
          bubbles of car-<lb break="no"/>bonic acid gas, why a glass filled<lb break="yes"/>with
          Champagne wine is little sono-<lb break="no"/>rous so long as the gas is evolved,<lb
            break="yes"/>and continues to pass through the<lb break="yes"/>strata of the
          liquid.&#x201D;</p> <p>This hypothesis is well worth<lb break="yes"/>further investigations; but we must<lb break="yes"/>surrender it to the
          scientific jour-<lb break="no"/>nals, and continue our more mixed<lb break="yes"/>career.</p> <p>&#x201C;The Indians of Atures,&#x201D; says<lb break="yes"/>Mr. H., &#x201C;are mild, moderate,
            and<lb break="yes"/>accustomed, from the effects of<lb break="yes"/>their idleness, to
          the greatest priva-<lb break="no"/>tions. Formerly, excited to labour<lb break="yes"/>by
          the Jesuits, they did not want<lb break="yes"/>for food. The fathers cultivated<lb
            break="yes"/>
          <pb n="477" facs="#f0004"/><cb/> maize, French beans, (<hi rendition="#i">frisoles</hi>),
            and<lb break="yes"/>other European vegetables; they<lb break="yes"/>even planted sweet
          oranges and<lb break="yes"/>tamarinds round the villages; and<lb break="yes"/>they
          possessed twenty or thirty<lb break="yes"/>thousand head of cows and horses,<lb
            break="yes"/>in the savannahs of Atures and Ca-<lb break="no"/>richana. They had at
          their service<lb break="yes"/>a great number of slaves and ser-<lb break="no"/>vants (<hi
            rendition="#i">peones</hi>,) to take care of their<lb break="yes"/>herds. Nothing is now
            cultivated<lb break="yes"/>but a little cassava, and a few plan-<lb break="no"/>tains.
          The fertility of the soil how-<lb break="no"/>ever is such, that at Atures I count-<lb
            break="no"/>ed on a single branch of musa 108<lb break="yes"/>fruits, 4 or 5 of which
          would almost<lb break="yes"/>suffice for the daily nourishment of<lb break="yes"/>a man.
          The culture of maize is en-<lb break="no"/>tirely neglected, and the horses and<lb
            break="yes"/>cows have disappeared. Near the<lb break="yes"/><hi rendition="#i"
            >raudal</hi>, a part of the village still<lb break="yes"/>bears the name of <hi
            rendition="#i">Passo del ganado</hi><lb break="yes"/>(ford of the cattle,) while the
            de-<lb break="no"/>scendants of those very Indians,<lb break="yes"/>whom the Jesuits had
          assembled in<lb break="yes"/>a mission, speak of horned cattle as<lb break="yes"/>of
          animals of a race that is lost. In<lb break="yes"/>going up the Oroonoko, toward San<lb
            break="yes"/>Carlos del Rio Negro, we saw the<lb break="yes"/>last cow at Carichana. The
            fathers<lb break="yes"/>of the Observance, who now govern<lb break="yes"/>these vast
          countries, did not imme-<lb break="no"/>diately succeed the Jesuits. During<lb break="yes"
          />an interregnum of eighteen years<lb break="yes"/>the missions were visited only from<lb
            break="yes"/>time to time, and by Capuchin monks.<lb break="yes"/>The agents of the
          secular govern-<lb break="no"/>ment, under the title of <hi rendition="#i">Commis-<lb
              break="no"/>sioners of the King</hi>, managed the<lb break="yes"/><hi rendition="#i"
            >hatos</hi> or farms of the Jesuits with<lb break="yes"/>culpable negligence. They
            killed<lb break="yes"/>the cattle in order to sell the hides.<lb break="yes"/>Many
          heifers were devoured by<lb break="yes"/>tigers, and a greater number perish-<lb
            break="no"/>ed in consequence of wounds made<lb break="yes"/>by the bats of the <hi
            rendition="#i">raudales</hi>, which<lb break="yes"/>are much less, but far bolder
            than<lb break="yes"/>the bats of the Llanos. At the time<lb break="yes"/>of the
          expedition of the boundaries,<lb break="yes"/>the horses of Encaramada, Cari-<lb
            break="no"/>chana, and Atures, were conveyed<lb break="yes"/>as far as San Jose of
            Maravitanos,<lb break="yes"/>where, on the banks of the Rio<lb break="yes"/>Negro, the
          Portuguese could only<lb break="yes"/>procure them after a long passage,<lb break="yes"
          />and of a very inferior quality, by<lb break="yes"/>the river Amazon and Grand Para.<lb
            break="yes"/>Since the year 1795, the cattle of<lb break="yes"/>the Jesuits have
          entirely disap-<lb break="no"/>peared. There now remains in<lb break="yes"/>testimony of
          the ancient cultivation<lb break="yes"/>of these countries, and the indus-<lb break="no"
          />trious activity of the first mission-<lb break="no"/>aries, only a few trunks of the
            orange<lb break="yes"/><cb/>and tamarind in the savannahs, sur-<lb break="no"/>rounded
          by wild trees.</p> <p>&#x201C;The tigers, or jaguars, which<lb break="yes"/>are less dangerous for the cattle<lb break="yes"/>than the bats,
          come into the village<lb break="yes"/>at Atures, and devour the pigs of<lb break="yes"/>the poor Indians. The
          missionary<lb break="yes"/>related to us a striking instance of<lb break="yes"/>the familiarity of these
          animals,<lb break="yes"/>upon the whole so ferocious. Some<lb break="yes"/>months before our arrival, a
          jaguar,<lb break="yes"/>which was thought to be young, <lb break="yes"/>though of a large size, had wounded<lb break="yes"/>a child in playing with him; I use<lb break="yes"/>confidently this expression, which<lb break="yes"/>may seem
          strange, having on the spot<lb break="yes"/>verified facts which are not without<lb break="yes"/>interest in the
          history of the man-<lb break="no"/>ners of animals. Two Indian child-<lb break="no"/>ren, a boy and a girl,
          about eight,<lb break="yes"/>and nine years of age, were seated<lb break="yes"/>on the grass near the village of
          <lb break="yes"/>Atures, in the middle of a savannah,<lb break="yes"/>which we have often traversed. At<lb break="yes"/>two
          o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon, a <lb break="yes"/>jaguar issued from the forest, and<lb break="yes"/>approached
          the children, bounding<lb break="yes"/>around them; sometimes he hid him-<lb break="no"/>self in the high grass,
          sometimes<lb break="yes"/>he sprang forward, his back bent,<lb break="yes"/>his head hung down, in the
          manner<lb break="yes"/>of our cats. The little boy, ignorant<lb break="yes"/>of his danger, seemed to be
          sensible<lb break="yes"/>of it only when the jaguar with one<lb break="yes"/>of bis paws gave him some blows
          on<lb break="yes"/>the head. These blows, at first<lb break="yes"/>slight, became ruder and ruder; the<lb break="yes"/>claws of the jaguar wounded the<lb break="yes"/>child, and the blood flowed with<lb break="yes"/>violence. The
          little girl then took<lb break="yes"/>a branch of a tree, struck the ani-<lb break="no"/>mal, and it fled from
          her. The In-<lb break="no"/>dians ran up at the cries of the<lb break="yes"/>children, and saw the jaguar,
          which<lb break="yes"/>retired bounding, without the least <lb break="yes"/>show of resistance.</p> <p>&#x201C;The little boy was brought to<lb break="yes"/>us, who appeared lively and intelli-<lb break="no"/>gent. The
          claw of the jaguar had <lb break="yes"/>taken away the skin from the lower<lb break="yes"/>part of the forehead,
          and there was<lb break="yes"/>a second scar at the top of the<lb break="yes"/>head.&#x201D;</p>

        <p>&#x201C;Among the monkeys,&#x201D; the au-<lb break="no"/>thor continues, &#x201C;which
          we saw at<lb break="yes"/>the mission of the Atures, we found<lb break="yes"/>one new
          species of the tribe of <hi rendition="#i">sais</hi><lb break="yes"/>and <hi
            rendition="#i">sajous</hi>, which the Creoles vul-<lb break="no"/>garly call <hi
            rendition="#i">machis</hi>. It is the <hi rendition="#i">ouava-<lb break="no"/>pavi</hi>
          with grey hair and a bluish<lb break="yes"/>face. It has the orbits of the eyes<lb
            break="yes"/>and forehead as white as snow, which<lb break="yes"/>at first sight
          distinguish it from the<lb break="yes"/><hi rendition="#i">simia capucina</hi>, the <hi rendition="#i">simia apella</hi>, the<lb
            break="yes"/><hi rendition="#i">simia trepida</hi>, and the other weeping<lb break="yes"/>monkeys
          hitherto so confusedly de-<lb break="no"/>scribed. This little animal is as<lb break="yes"
          />gentle as it is ugly. Every day in<lb break="yes"/>the court-yard of the missionary
            it<lb break="yes"/>seized a pig, upon which it remain-<lb break="no"/>ed from morning
          till night, travers-<lb break="no"/>ing the savannahs. We have also<lb break="yes"/>seen
          it upon the back of a large<lb break="yes"/>cat, which bad been brought up<lb break="yes"
          />with it in father Zea's house.</p>
        <p>&#x201C;It was among the cataracts that<lb break="yes"/>we began to hear of the hairy man<lb break="yes"/>of
          the woods, called salvaje, that<lb break="yes"/>carries off women, constructs huts,<lb break="yes"/>and
          sometimes eats human flesh.<lb break="yes"/>The Tamanacks call it <hi rendition="#i">achi</hi>, and
          the<lb break="yes"/>Maypures <hi rendition="#i">vasitri</hi>, or <hi rendition="#i">great
          devil</hi>.<lb break="yes"/>The natives and the missionaries<lb break="yes"/>have no doubt of the existence
          of<lb break="yes"/>this anthropomorphous monkey,<lb break="yes"/>which they singularly dread. Father<lb break="yes"/>Gili
          gravely relates the history of<lb break="yes"/>a lady in the town of San Carlos,<lb break="yes"/>who much
          praised the gentle cha-<lb break="no"/>racter and attentions of the man of<lb break="yes"/>the woods. She lived
          several years<lb break="yes"/>with one in great domestic harmony,<lb break="yes"/>and only requested some
          hunters to<lb break="yes"/>take her back, &#x2018;because she was<lb break="yes"/>tired, she and her children (a
          little<lb break="yes"/>hairy also), of living far from the<lb break="yes"/>church and the sacraments.&#x2019;
          The<lb break="yes"/>same author, notwithstanding his<lb break="yes"/>credulity, confesses, that he had not<lb break="yes"/>been able to find an Indian, who<lb break="yes"/>asserted positively that he had seen<lb break="yes"/>the <hi
            rendition="#i">salvaje</hi> with his own eyes.</p>
        <p>&#x201C;This fable, which the missiona-<lb break="no"/>ries, the European planters, and
            the<lb break="yes"/>negroes of Africa, have no doubt<lb break="yes"/>embellished with
          many features<lb break="yes"/>taken from the description of the<lb break="yes"/>
          <pb n="487" facs="#f0005"/>
          <cb/> manners of the ourang-outang, the<lb break="yes"/>gibbon, the jocko or
            chimpanzee,<lb break="yes"/>and the pongo, pursued us during<lb break="yes"/>five years
          from the northern to the<lb break="yes"/>southern hemisphere, and we were<lb break="yes"
          />every where blamed, in the most<lb break="yes"/>cultivated class of society, for
            being<lb break="yes"/>the only persons to doubt the exist-<lb break="no"/>ence of the
          great anthropomorphous<lb break="yes"/>monkey of America. We shall first<lb break="yes"
          />observe, that there are certain re-<lb break="no"/>gions, where this belief is
            particu-<lb break="no"/>larly prevalent among the people;<lb break="yes"/>such are the
          banks of the Upper<lb break="yes"/>Oroonoko, the valley of Upar near<lb break="yes"/>the
          Lake of Maracaybo, the moun-<lb break="no"/>tains of Santa Martha and of Meri-<lb
            break="no"/>da, the provinces of Quixos, and the<lb break="yes"/>banks of the Amazon
          near Tome-<lb break="no"/>penda. In all these places, so dis-<lb break="no"/>tant one from
          the other, it is repeat-<lb break="no"/>ed, that the <hi rendition="#i">salvaje</hi> is
          easily recog-<lb break="no"/>nized by the traces of its feet, the<lb break="yes"/>toes of
          which are turned backward.<lb break="yes"/>But if there exist a monkey of a<lb break="yes"
          />large size in the New Continent,<lb break="yes"/>how has it happened that, during<lb
            break="yes"/>three centuries, no man worthy of<lb break="yes"/>belief has been able to
          procure the<lb break="yes"/>skin of one? Several hypotheses<lb break="yes"/>present
          themselves to the mind, in<lb break="yes"/>order to explain the source of so<lb
            break="yes"/>ancient an error or belief. Has the<lb break="yes"/>famous <hi
            rendition="#i">capuchin</hi> monkey of Esme-<lb break="no"/>ralda, the canine teeth of
          which are<lb break="yes"/>more than six lines and a half long,<lb break="yes"/>the
          physiognomy much more like<lb break="yes"/>man&#x2019;s than that of the ourang-<lb
            break="hyph-yes"/>outang, and which, when irritated,<lb break="yes"/>rubs its beard with
          its hand, given<lb break="yes"/>rise to the fable of the <hi rendition="#i">salvaje?</hi>
            It<lb break="yes"/>is not so large indeed as the coaita,<lb break="yes"/>(<hi
            rendition="#i">simia paniscus</hi>) but when seen at<lb break="yes"/>the top of a tree,
          and the head only<lb break="yes"/>visible, it might easily be taken for<lb break="yes"/>a
          human being. It may be also (and<lb break="yes"/>this opinion appears to me the most<lb
            break="yes"/>probable) that the man of the woods<lb break="yes"/>was one of those large
          bears, the<lb break="yes"/>footsteps of which resemble those<lb break="yes"/>of a man, and
          which is believed in<lb break="yes"/>every country to attack women.<lb break="yes"/>The
          animal killed in my time at<lb break="yes"/>the foot of the mountains of Merida,<lb
            break="yes"/>and sent, by the name of <hi rendition="#i">salvaje</hi> to<lb break="yes"
          />Colonel Ungaro, the governor of the<lb break="yes"/>province Varinas, was in fact a
            bear,<lb break="yes"/>with black and smooth fur.&#x201D;</p>
        <p>These extraordinary accounts are<lb break="yes"/>succeeded by a detailed history of<lb
            break="yes"/>the moschettoes of this region, per-<lb break="no"/>haps the most
          remarkable of all its<lb break="yes"/>animal phenomena.</p>
        <p>&#x201C;Persons who have not navigated<lb break="yes"/><cb/>the great rivers of
          equinoctial Ame-<lb break="no"/>rica, for instance, the Oroonoko and<lb break="yes"/>the
          Rio Magdalena, can scarcely<lb break="yes"/>conceive how, without interruption,<lb
            break="yes"/>at every instant of life, you may be<lb break="yes"/>tormented by insects
          flying in the<lb break="yes"/>air, and how the multitude of these<lb break="yes"/>little
          animals may render vast re-<lb break="no"/>gions wholly uninhabitable. How-<lb break="no"

            break="no"/>ever lively an interest you may take<lb break="yes"/>in the objects of your
          researches, it<lb break="yes"/>is impossible not to be constantly<lb break="yes"

          and <hi rendition="#i">tempraneroes</hi>, that<lb break="yes"/>cover the face and hands,
          pierce the<lb break="yes"/>clothes with their long sucker in<lb break="yes"/>the form of a
          needle, and, getting<lb break="yes"/>into the mouth and nostrils, set you<lb break="yes"
          />coughing and sneezing whenever<lb break="yes"/>you attempt to speak in the open<lb
            break="yes"/>air. In the missions of the Oroono-<lb break="no"/>ko, in the villages
          placed on the<lb break="yes"/>banks of the river, surrounded by<lb break="yes"/>immense
          forests, the <hi rendition="#i">plaga de las<lb break="yes"/>moscas</hi>, the plague of
          the flies, af-<lb break="no"/>fords an inexhaustible subject of<lb break="yes"
          />conversation. When two persons<lb break="yes"/>meet in the morning, the first ques-<lb
            break="no"/>tions they address to each other are,<lb break="yes"/>&#x2018;How did you
          find the zancudoes<lb break="yes"/>during the night? How are we to-<lb break="no"/>day for
          the moschettoes.&#x2019; These<lb break="yes"/>questions remind us of a Chinese<lb
            break="yes"/>form of politeness, which indicates<lb break="yes"/>the ancient state of
          the country<lb break="yes"/>where it took birth. Salutations were<lb break="yes"/>made
          heretofore in the <hi rendition="#i">celestial em-<lb break="no"/>pire</hi>, in the
          following words, <hi rendition="#i">vou-<lb break="hyph-yes"/>tou-hou</hi>, &#x2018;Have
          you been incommo-<lb break="no"/>ded in the night by the serpents?&#x2019;<lb break="yes"
          />We shall soon see, that on the banks<lb break="yes"/>of the Tuamini, in the river
            Magda-<lb break="no"/>lena, and still more at Choco, the<lb break="yes"/>country of gold
          and platina, the<lb break="yes"/>Chinese compliment on the ser-<lb break="no"/>pents might
          be added to that of the<lb break="yes"/>moschettoes.&#x201D;</p>
        <p>Other curious facts are recorded,<lb break="yes"/>and illustrate this subject. Mr. H.<lb break="yes"/>says&#x2014;</p>
        <p>&#x201C;At Mandavaca we found an old<lb break="yes"/>missionary, who told us with an
            air<lb break="yes"/>of sadness, that he bad spent <hi rendition="#i">his<lb break="yes"
            />twenty years of moschettoes</hi> in Ame-<lb break="no"/>rica. He desired us to look
          well at<lb break="yes"/>his legs, that we might be able to<lb break="yes"/>tell one day,
          &#x2018;poor alla (beyond sea)<lb break="yes"/>what the poor monks suffer in the<lb
            break="yes"/>forests of Cassiquiare.&#x2019; Every sting<lb break="yes"/>leaving a small
          darkish brown point,<lb break="yes"/>his legs were so speckled, that it<lb break="yes"
          />was difficult to recognize the white-<lb break="no"/><cb/>ness of his skin through the
          spots of<lb break="yes"/>coagulated blood. If the insects of<lb break="yes"/>the simulium
          genus abound in the<lb break="yes"/>Cassiquiare, which has <hi rendition="#i">white
            waters</hi>,<lb break="yes"/>the culices, or <hi rendition="#i">zancudoes</hi>, are
            so<lb break="yes"/>much the more rare: you scarcely<lb break="yes"/>find any there,
          while on the rivers<lb break="yes"/>of <hi rendition="#i">black waters</hi>, in the
          Atabapo and<lb break="yes"/>the Rio Negro, there are generally<lb break="yes"/>some <hi
            rendition="#i">zancudoes</hi> and no <hi rendition="#i">moschettoes</hi>.&#x201D;</p>
        <p>&#x201C;I have just shown, from my own<lb break="yes"/>observations, how much the
            geogra-<lb break="no"/>phical distribution of venomous in-<lb break="no"/>sects varies
          in this labyrinth of ri-<lb break="no"/>vers with white and black waters.<lb break="yes"
          />It were to be wished, that a learned<lb break="yes"/>entomologist could study on the<lb
            break="yes"/>spot the specific differences of these<lb break="yes"/>noxious insects,
          which in the torrid<lb break="yes"/>zone, in spite of their littleness, act<lb break="yes"
          />an important part in the economy of<lb break="yes"/>nature. What appeared to us very<lb
            break="yes"/>remarkable, and is a fact, known to<lb break="yes"/>all the missionaries,
          is, that the dif-<lb break="no"/>ferent species do not associate to-<lb break="no"
          />gether, and that at different hours of<lb break="yes"/>the day you are stung by a
            distinct<lb break="yes"/>species. Every time that the scene<lb break="yes"/>changes, and
          to use the simple ex-<lb break="no"/>pression of the missionaries, other<lb break="yes"
          />insects &#x2018;mount guard,&#x2019; you have a<lb break="yes"/>few minutes, often a
          quarter of an<lb break="yes"/>hour, of repose. The insects that<lb break="yes"/>disappear
          have not their places in-<lb break="no"/>stantly supplied in equal numbers<lb break="yes"
          />by their successors. From half af-<lb break="no"/>ter six in the morning till five in<lb
            break="yes"/>the afternoon, the air is filled with<lb break="yes"/>moschettoes; which
          have not, as we<lb break="yes"/>find related in some travels, the<lb break="yes"/>form of
          our gnats, but that of a small<lb break="yes"/>fly. They are simuliums of the fa-<lb
            break="no"/>mily nemocer&#x00E6; of the system of<lb break="yes"/>Latreille. Their sting
          is as pain-<lb break="no"/>ful as that of <hi rendition="#i">stomoxes</hi>. It leaves a<lb
            break="yes"/>little reddish-brown spot, which is<lb break="yes"/>extravasated and
          coagulated blood,<lb break="yes"/>where their proboscis has pierced<lb break="yes"/>the
          skin. An hour before sun-set a<lb break="yes"/>species of small gnats, called <hi
            rendition="#i">tem-<lb break="no"/>praneros</hi>, because they appear also<lb
            break="yes"/>at sun-rise, take the place of the<lb break="yes"/>moschettoes. Their
          presence scarce-<lb break="no"/>ly lasts an hour and a half; they dis-<lb break="no"
          />appear between six and seven in the<lb break="yes"/>evening, or, as they say here,
            after<lb break="yes"/>the <hi rendition="#i">Angelus</hi> (<hi rendition="#i">a la
            oracion</hi>). After a<lb break="yes"/>few minutes repose, you feel your-<lb break="no"
          />self stund by <hi rendition="#i">zancudoes</hi>, another<lb break="yes"/>species of gnat
          (culex) with very<lb break="yes"/>long legs. The zancudo, the probos-<lb break="no"/>cis
          of which contains a sharp point-<lb break="no"/>ed sucker, causes the most acute<lb
            break="yes"/>pain, and a swelling that remains<lb break="yes"/>
          <pb n="488" facs="#f0006"/>
          <cb/>several weeks. Its hum resembles<lb break="yes"/>that of our gnats in Europe, but
            is<lb break="yes"/>louder and more prolonged. The<lb break="yes"/>Indians pretend to
          distinguish &#x2018;by <lb break="yes"/>their song&#x2019; the <hi rendition="#i"
            >zancudoes</hi> and the<lb break="yes"/><hi rendition="#i">tempraneroes</hi>; the latter
          of which are<lb break="yes"/>real <hi rendition="#i">twilight insects</hi>, while the <hi
            rendition="#i">zan-<lb break="no"/>cudoes</hi> are most frequently <hi rendition="#i"
              >noctur-<lb break="no"/>nal insects</hi>, and disappear towards<lb break="yes"
          />sun-rise.</p>
        <p>&#x201C;The <hi rendition="#i">culices</hi> of South America,<lb break="yes"/>have
          generally the wings, corselet,<lb break="yes"/>and legs of an azure colour, annulat-<lb
            break="no"/>ed, and variable from a mixture of<lb break="yes"/>spots of a metallic
          lustre. Here, as<lb break="yes"/>in Europe, the males, which are dis-<lb break="no"
          />tinguished by their feathered anten-<lb break="no"/>n&#x00E6;, are extremely rare; you
          are sel-<lb break="no"/>dom stung except by females. The<lb break="yes"/>preponderance of
          this sex explains<lb break="yes"/>the immense increase of the species,<lb break="yes"
          />each female laying several hundred<lb break="yes"/>eggs. In going up one of the great<lb
            break="yes"/>rivers of America, it is observed,<lb break="yes"/>that the appearance of a
          new species<lb break="yes"/>of <hi rendition="#i">culex</hi> denotes the approximity of<lb

        <p>&#x201C;The whites born in the torrid<lb break="yes"/>zone walk barefoot with impunity<lb break="yes"/>in the

          </choice>In the day, even when labouring at<lb break="yes"/>the oar, the natives, in order to
          chase<lb break="yes"/>the insects, are continually giving<lb break="yes"/>one another smart slaps with the<lb break="yes"/>palm of the hand. Rude in all their<lb break="yes"/>movements, they strike themselves<lb break="yes"/>and their
          comrades mechanically<lb break="yes"/>during their sleep. The violence of<lb break="yes"/>their blows reminds us
          of the Persi-<lb break="no"/>an tale of the bear, that tried to kill<lb break="yes"/>with his paw the insects on
          the fore-<lb break="no"/>head of his sleeping master. Near<lb break="yes"/>Maypures we saw some young
          Indi-<lb break="no"/>ans seated in a circle and rubbing<lb break="yes"/>cruelly each others backs with the<lb break="yes"/>bark of trees dried at the fire. In-<lb break="no"/>dian women were occupied with a<lb break="yes"/>degree of

          <cb/>in extirpating by means of a sharp<lb break="yes"/>bone the little mass of coagulated<lb break="yes"/>blood, that forms the centre of eve-<lb break="no"/>ry sting, and gives the skin a speck-<lb break="no"/>led
          appearance. One of the most<lb break="yes"/>barbarous nations of the Oroonoko,<lb break="yes"/>that of the

          the villages<lb break="yes"/>of the Rio Magdalena the Indians<lb break="yes"/>often invited us to stretch
          ourselves<lb break="yes"/>with them on ox-skins, near the<lb break="yes"/>church, in the middle of the <hi

          the<lb break="yes"/>Upper Oroonoko and the Cassi-<lb break="no"/>quiare, seeing that Mr. Bonpland<lb break="yes"/>could not
          prepare his herbal, on ac-<lb break="no"/>count of the continual torment of<lb break="yes"/>the moschettoes,
          invited him to en-<lb break="no"/>ter their oveus, (<hi rendition="#i">hornitos</hi>). Thus<lb break="yes"/>they
          call little chambers, without<lb break="yes"/>doors or windows, into which they<lb break="yes"/>creep
          horizontally through a very<lb break="yes"/>small opening. When they have<lb break="yes"/>driven away the
          insects by means<lb break="yes"/>of a fire of wet brush-wood, which<lb break="yes"/>emits a great deal of smoke,
          they<lb break="yes"/>close the opening of the oven. The<lb break="yes"/>absence of moschettoes is purchased<lb break="yes"/>clearly enough by the excessive heat<lb break="yes"/>of stagnant air, and the smoke of a<lb break="yes"/>torch
          of <hi rendition="#i">copal</hi>, which lights the oven<lb break="yes"/>during your stay in it. Mr.

        <p>&#x201C;It is difficult not to smile at<lb break="yes"/>hearing the missionaries dispute on<lb break="yes"/>the
          size and voracity of the mos-<lb break="no"/>chettoes at different parts of the same<lb break="yes"/>river. In
          the centre of a country ig-<lb break="no"/>norant of what is passing in the rest<lb break="yes"/>of the world,
          this is the favorite<lb break="yes"/>subject of conversation. &#x2018;How I<lb break="yes"/>pity your
          situation!&#x2019; said the mis-<lb break="no"/>sionary of the raudales to the mis-<lb break="no"/>sionary of

          of tigers and monkeys;<lb break="yes"/>with you fish is still more rare, and<lb break="yes"/>the heat more
          violent; but as for my<lb break="yes"/>flies, (<hi rendition="#i">mia moscas</hi>) I can boast,
          that<lb break="yes"/>with one of mine I would beat three<lb break="yes"/>of yours.&#x2019;</p>
        <p>&#x201C;This voracity of insects in cer-<lb break="no"/>
          <cb/>tain spots, the rage with which they<lb break="yes"/>attack man, the activity of the
            ve-<lb break="no"/>nom varying in the same species,<lb break="yes"/>are very remarkable
          facts; which<lb break="yes"/>find their analogy, however, in the<lb break="yes"/>classes
          of large animals. The cro-<lb break="no"/>codile of Angostura pursues men,<lb break="yes"

          cowardly in comparison to<lb break="yes"/>those of the Upper Oroonoko. The<lb break="yes"

            place="foot" n="*">&#x201C;I might have added the example of<lb break="yes"/>the

        <p>&#x201C;In every part of the forests, far<lb break="yes"/>from any human habitation, on
            dig-<lb break="no"/>ging the earth, fragments of pottery<lb break="yes"/>and delft are

          preserve a peculiar<lb break="yes"/>type or style, and to follow the me-<lb break="no"

        <p>Above Maypure this is indeed a<lb break="yes"/>&#x201C;New World:&#x201D; Mr. Humboldt
          says:</p>
        <p>&#x201C;When the traveller has passed<lb break="yes"/>the great cataracts, he feels as if
            he<lb break="yes"/>were in a new world; and had over-<lb break="no"/>stepped the
          barriers which nature<lb break="yes"/>seems to have raised between the<lb break="yes"
          />civilized countries of the coast and<lb break="yes"/>the savage and unknown interior.<lb
            break="yes"/>Toward the east, in the bluish dis-<lb break="no"/>tance, appeared for the
          last time,<lb break="yes"/>the high chain of the Cunavami<lb break="yes"/>mountains. Its
          long horizontal<lb break="yes"/>ridge reminded us of the Mesa of<lb break="yes"
          />Bergantin, near Cumana; but it<lb break="yes"/>terminates by a truncated summit.<lb
            break="yes"/><cb/>The peak of Calitamini (the name<lb break="yes"/>given to this summit)
          glows at sun-<lb break="hyph-yes"/>set as with reddish fire. This ap-<lb break="no"
          />pearance is every day the same.<lb break="yes"/>No one ever approached the sum-<lb
            break="no"/>mit of this mountain, the height of<lb break="yes"/>which does not exceed
          six hundred<lb break="yes"/>toises. I believe this splendor, com-<lb break="no"/>monly
          reddish and sometimes silve-<lb break="no"/>ry, to be a reflexion produced by<lb
            break="yes"/>large plates of talc, or by gneiss<lb break="yes"/>passing into mica-slate.
          The whole<lb break="yes"/>of this country contains granitic<lb break="yes"/>rocks, on
          which here and there, in lit-<lb break="no"/>tle plains, an argillaceous gritstone<lb
            break="yes"/>immediately reposes, containing frag-<lb break="no"/>ments of quartz, and
          of brown iron ore.</p>
        <p>&#x201C;In going to the <hi rendition="#i">embarcadere</hi>&#x201D; he<lb break="yes"/>continues,
          &#x201C;we caught on the trunk<lb break="yes"/>of a hevea a new species of tree frog,<lb break="yes"/>remarkable
          for its beautiful colours;<lb break="yes"/>it had a yellow belly, the back and<lb break="yes"/>head of a fine
          velvetty purple, and<lb break="yes"/>a very narrow stripe of white from<lb break="yes"/>the point of the nose to
          the hinder<lb break="yes"/>extremities. This frog was two in-<lb break="no"/>ches long, and allied to the <hi
            rendition="#i">rana<lb break="yes"/>tinctoria</hi>, the blood of which, it is<lb break="yes"/>asserted,
          introduced into the skin<lb break="yes"/>of a parrot, in places where the fea-<lb break="no"/>thers have been
          plucked out, occa-<lb break="no"/>sions the growth of frizzled feathers<lb break="yes"/>of a yellow or red colour.<choice>

        <p>But this is not only the region of<lb break="yes"/>real wonders; it has its fictions also.</p>
        <p>&#x201C;The forests of Sipapo are alto-<lb break="no"/>gether unknown, and there the
          mis-<lb break="no"/>sionaries place the nation of <hi rendition="#i">Rayas</hi>,<lb break="yes"/>who have their
          mouth in the navel.<lb break="yes"/>An old Indian, whom we met at Ca-<lb break="no"/>richano, and who boasted of
          having<lb break="yes"/>often eaten human flesh, had seen<lb break="yes"/>these <hi rendition="#i">acephali</hi>
          with his own eyes.<lb break="yes"/>These absurd fables are spread as<lb break="yes"/>far as the Llanos, where you
          are not<lb break="yes"/>always permitted to doubt the ex-<lb break="no"/>istence of the <hi rendition="#i"
            >raya</hi> Indians. In eve-<lb break="no"/>ry zone intolerance accompanies<lb break="yes"/>credulity; and it
          might be said, that<lb break="yes"/>the fictions of ancient geographers<lb break="yes"/>had passed from one
          hemisphere to<lb break="yes"/>the other, did we not know, that the<lb break="yes"/>most fantastic productions of
          the<lb break="yes"/>imagination, like the works of nature,<lb break="yes"/>furnish every where a certain
          ana-<lb break="no"/>logy of aspect and form.&#x201D;</p>
