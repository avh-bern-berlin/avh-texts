<div n="1"><head><hi rendition="#k">A Curious Rose Tree.</hi></head><p>&#x2014;In the wild rose tree<lb/>of the crypt of the Cathedral of Hildesheim, said to<lb/>be a
                    thousand years old, it is the root only, and not<lb/>the stem, which is eight
                    centuries old, according<lb/>to accurate information, derived from ancient
                    and<lb/>trustworthy original documents, for the knowledge<lb/>of which I am
                    indebted to the kindness of Stadt-<lb/>gerichts-Assessor Romer. A legend
                    connects the<lb/>rose tree with a vow made by the first founder of<lb/>the
                    Cathedral, Ludwig the Pious; and an original<lb/>document of the 11th century
                    says, that when<lb/>Bishop Hezilo rebuilt the cathedral, which had
                    been<lb/>burnt down, he enclosed the roots of the rose tree<lb/>with a vault
                    which still exists, raised upon this<lb/>vault the crypt, which was
                    re-consecrated in 1061,<lb/>and spread out the branches of the rose tree
                    upon<lb/>the walls. The stem now living is twenty-six and a<lb/>half feet high
                    and about two inches thick, and the<lb/>outspread branches cover about
                    thirty-two feet of<lb/>the external wall of the eastern crypt. It is
                    doubt-<lb/>less of considerable antiquity, and well deserving of<lb/>the
                    celebrity which it has gained throughout Ger-<lb/>many.&#x2014;<hi
