I have felt very sensibly the mark of esteem you have accorded me, in placing my name<lb/>at the head of your excellent work.</p><lb/><p>Be pleased to accept in return the expression of my lively and affectionate gratitude. I am persuaded<lb/>that in publishing the Physical Atlas, in perfecting the useful work of Berghaus, by enriching it with<lb/>the principal results of recent investigations, under the approbation of an illustrious man, Sir David<lb/>Brewster, you have rendered a most essential service to the dissemination of a knowledge of Cosmo-<lb/>graphy.</p><lb/><p>The execution of the plates corresponds, in the elegance and perspicuity of the engraving, with
                    the<lb/>scientific solidity of the materials. Two copies of the Physical Atlas,
                    complete and bound, are desired<lb/>for the private library of the King of
                    Prussia. Have the goodness to address them to M. le Chevalier<lb/>Bunsen,
                    Prussian Minister at London, who will pay for them. I also beg of you to add <hi
