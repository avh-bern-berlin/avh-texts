                    <hi rendition="#k">In</hi> 1797, the missionary of San<lb break="yes"/>Fernando
                    had led his Indians to the<lb break="yes"/>banks of the Rio Guaviare, on one
                        of<lb break="yes"/>those hostile occasions, which are pro-<lb break="no"
                    />hibited alike by religion and the Spanish<lb break="yes"/>laws. They found, in
                    an <choice><sic>Italian</sic><corr type="editorial">Indian</corr></choice>
                        hut,<lb break="yes"/>a Guahibi mother with three children,<lb break="yes"
                    />two of whom were still infants. They<lb break="yes"/>were occupied in
                    preparing the flour of<lb break="yes"/>Cassava. Resistance was impossible;<lb
                        break="yes"/>the father was gone to fish, the unhap-<lb break="no"/>py
                    mother tried in vain to flee with her<lb break="yes"/>children. Scarcely had she
                    reached the<lb break="yes"/>Savannah, when <choice><sic>see</sic><corr
                            type="editorial">she</corr></choice> was seized by the<lb break="yes"
                    />Indians of the mission, who hunt men<lb break="yes"/>with the ferocity of the
                    whites and<lb break="yes"/>the negroes in Africa. The wretched<lb break="yes"
                    />mother and her children were bound,<lb break="yes"/>and dragged to the bank of
                    the river.<lb break="yes"/>The monk, seated in his boat, waited<lb break="yes"
                    />the issue of this expedition of barba-<lb break="no"/>rity, and of which he
                    partook not the<lb break="yes"/>danger. Had the mother made too<lb break="yes"
                    />violent a resistance, the Indians would<lb break="yes"/>unquestionably have
                    killed her, for any<lb break="yes"/>excess is permitted them when they go<lb
                        break="yes"/>to the conquest of souls, as they term<lb break="yes"/>it (a la
                    conquista espiritual), and it is<lb break="yes"/>children whom they particularly
                        seek<lb break="yes"/>to capture, in order to treat them, in<lb break="yes"
                    />the mission, as poitos, or slaves of the<lb break="yes"/>Christians. The
                    prisoners were carried<lb break="yes"/>to San Fernando, in the hope that, in<lb
                        break="yes"/>the event of escape, the mother would<lb break="yes"/>be unable
                    to find her way back to her<lb break="yes"/>house by land.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Far from those children who had<lb break="yes"/>accompanied their father on the
                        day<lb break="yes"/>on which she had been carried off,<lb break="yes"/>this
                    unhappy woman shewed signs of<lb break="yes"/>the deepest despair. She attempted
                        to<lb break="yes"/>take back to her family the children<lb break="yes"/>who
                    had been thus brutally snatched<lb break="yes"/>away by the missionary, and fled
                        with<lb break="yes"/>them repeatedly from the village of<lb break="yes"/>San
                    Fernando: but the Indians never<lb break="yes"/>failed to seize her anew; and
                    the mis-<lb break="no"/>sionary, after having caused the poor<lb break="yes"
                    />wretch to be mercilessly beaten, took<lb break="yes"/>the cruel resolution of
                    separating the<lb break="yes"/>mother from the two children, who<lb break="yes"
                    />had been carried off with her. She<lb break="yes"/>was now conveyed alone
                    toward the<lb break="yes"/>mission of the Rio Negro, going up<lb break="yes"
                    />the river Atabapo; slightly bound, she<lb break="yes"/>was seated at the bow
                    of the boat,<lb break="yes"/>
                    <cb/> utterly ignorant of the fate that awaited<lb break="yes"/>her; but she
                    judged, by the direction<lb break="yes"/>of the sun, that she was removed
                        far-<lb break="no"/>ther and farther from her hut and her<lb break="yes"
                    />native country. Seizing a favourable<lb break="yes"/>opportunity, she
                    succeeded in breaking<lb break="yes"/>her bonds, threw herself into the wa-<lb
                        break="no"/>ter, and swam to the left bank of the<lb break="yes"/>river. The
                    current carried her to a<lb break="yes"/>shelf of rock, which bears her name<lb
                        break="yes"/>to this day. Here she landed, and<lb break="yes"/>took shelter
                    in the woods: but the<lb break="yes"/>president of the missions, astonished<lb
                        break="yes"/>at her courage, ordered his Indians to<lb break="yes"/>row to
                    the shore, and followed the<lb break="yes"/>traces of the Guahibi. In the
                        evening<lb break="yes"/>the unhappy creature was brought<lb break="yes"
                    />back. Stretched upon the rock, still<lb break="yes"/>called (la piedra de la
                    Madre), a cruel<lb break="yes"/>punishment was inflicted on her with<lb
                        break="yes"/>those straps of manatee leather which<lb break="yes"/>serve for
                    whips in that country, and<lb break="yes"/>with which the Alcades are always<lb
                        break="yes"/>furnished; and the unhappy woman,<lb break="yes"/>her hands
                    tied behind her back with<lb break="yes"/>strong stalks of mavacure, was then<lb
                        break="yes"/>dragged to the mission of Javita.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>She was there thrown into one of<lb break="yes"/>the caravanseras that are called
                        Casa<lb break="yes"/>del Rey. It was during the rainy<lb break="yes"
                    />season, when the night was profoundly<lb break="yes"/>dark; forests, till
                    then, believed to be<lb break="yes"/>impenetrable, separated the mission of<lb
                        break="yes"/>Javita from that of San Fernando,<lb break="yes"/>the nearest
                    distance to which was<lb break="yes"/>twenty-five leagues in a straight line.<lb
                        break="yes"/>No other part of the country is known,<lb break="yes"/>but the
                    course of the rivers; nor does<lb break="yes"/>any man ever attempt to go by
                        land<lb break="yes"/>from one village to another, were they<lb break="yes"
                    />only a few leagues apart. But what<lb break="yes"/>difficulties shall stay a
                    mother, who is<lb break="yes"/>separated from her children? The<lb break="yes"
                    />children of this devoted and coura-<lb break="no"/>geous woman are at San
                    Fernando de<lb break="yes"/>Atabapo; nature cries out, inciting<lb break="yes"
                    />her to find them again; she conceives<lb break="yes"/>the possibility of
                    executing her project<lb break="yes"/>of delivering them from the hands of<lb
                        break="yes"/>Christians, and of bringing them back<lb break="yes"/>to their
                    father on the banks of the<lb break="yes"/>Guaviare. The Guahibi was
                        carelessly<lb break="yes"/>guarded in the caravansera. Her arms<lb
                        break="yes"/>being wounded, the Indians of Javita<lb break="yes"/>had
                    loosened her bonds, unknown to<lb break="yes"/>the missionary and the Alcades.
                        She<lb break="yes"/>succeeded, by the help of her teeth,<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="46" facs="#f0002"/>
                    <cb/> in breaking them entirely; disappeared<lb break="yes"/>during the night;
                    and at the fourth<lb break="yes"/>rising sun had actually arrived at the<lb
                        break="yes"/>mission of San Fernando, and was seen<lb break="yes"/>hovering
                    around the hut where her<lb break="yes"/>children were confined. &#x201C;What
                        that<lb break="yes"/>wonderful woman performed,&#x201D; added<lb break="yes"
                    />the missionary, who gave us this sad<lb break="yes"/>narrative, &#x201C;the
                    most robust Indian<lb break="yes"/>would not have ventured to undertake.<lb
                        break="yes"/>She traversed the woods at a season<lb break="yes"/>when the
                    sky is constantly covered<lb break="yes"/>with clouds, and the sun during
                        whole<lb break="yes"/>days appears but for a few minutes.<lb break="yes"
                    />The course of the waters affords her<lb break="yes"/>no indication by which to
                    direct her<lb break="yes"/>way! The inundations of the rivers<lb break="yes"
                    />forced her to go far from the banks of<lb break="yes"/>the main stream,
                    through the midst of<lb break="yes"/>woods, where the movement of the<lb
                        break="yes"/>waters is almost imperceptible. How<lb break="yes"/>often must
                    she have been stopped by<lb break="yes"/>the thorny lianas, that from a

                        break="yes"/>how she had sustained herself during<lb break="yes"/>the four
                    days? She replied, that, ex-<lb break="no"/>hausted with fatigue, she could
                        find<lb break="yes"/>no other nourishment than those great<lb break="yes"
                    />black ants, called vachacos, which<lb break="yes"/>climb the trees in long

                    />We pressed the missionary to tell us<lb break="yes"/>whether the Guahibi had,
                    after these<lb break="yes"/>unexampled exertions, been allowed<lb break="yes"
                    />peaceably to enjoy the happiness of<lb break="yes"/>remaining with her
                    children; and if<lb break="yes"/>any repentance had followed this ex-<lb

                    He refused, however, to<lb break="yes"/>satisfy our curiosity; but at our re-<lb
                        break="no"/>turn from the Rio Negro, we learnt,<lb break="yes"/>that the
                    Indian mother had not even<lb break="yes"/>been allowed time to cure her
                        wounds,<lb break="yes"/>but was again separated from her chil-<lb break="no"

                    where death<lb break="yes"/>afforded her a kind release from her<lb break="yes"
