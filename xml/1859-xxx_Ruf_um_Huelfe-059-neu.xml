    <p>Baron de Humboldt has addressed the following note<lb/>to the Berlin journals.
                &#x201C;Overwhelmed by the number of let-<lb/>ters sent me, which are increasing
                every day, amounting to from<lb/>1600 to 2000 per annum,&#x2014;many, <choice>
                    <sic>two</sic>
                    <corr type="editorial">too</corr>
                </choice>, being on the most futile<lb/>subjects, such as demands for my autograph
                and offers to cure me<lb/>of all diseases,&#x2014;I once more make a public appeal
                to the persons<lb/>who wish me well, and request them not to occupy themselves
                so<lb/>much with what concerns me, in order that with the diminution
                of<lb/>strength, physical and intallectual, which I experience, I may be<lb/>allowed
                a little leisure for study and composition. I trust that<lb/>this step, to which I
                have recourse with reluctance, will not be<lb/>interpreted unkindly.&#x201D;</p><lb/></body><back></back>
