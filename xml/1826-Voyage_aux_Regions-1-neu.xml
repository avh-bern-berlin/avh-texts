                    />at least of equal value with those which he has<lb break="yes"/>already
                    published. That part of America to<lb break="yes"/>which it relates is, from
                    present circumstances,<lb break="yes"/>more important than any other to which
                        our<lb break="yes"/>attention could be turned. It contains so much<lb
                        break="yes"/>valuable matter, that before it becomes more<lb break="yes"
                    />generally known to the British public through<lb break="yes"/>a translation,
                    we shall take upon ourselves the<lb break="yes"/>task of extracting from it at
                    least as much as<lb break="yes"/>seems deserving of immediate attention.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>It is one of the greatest merits of M. Hum-<lb break="no"/>boldt, that, with a
                    powerful imagination, and<lb break="yes"/>many of those faculties essential to
                    that elo-<lb break="no"/>quence which animates his narrative, he enters<lb
                        break="yes"/>into the most laborious investigations, and has<lb break="yes"
                    />given the most minute details on every point<lb break="yes"/>connected with
                    science. This depth of research<lb break="yes"/>has imparted to all his
                    publications a value which<lb break="yes"/>surpasses that of other writings on
                    similar sub-<lb break="no"/>jects, and will long outlast the present gene-<lb
                        break="no"/>ration.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>What we conceive to be most important is<lb break="yes"/>that upon which we
                    naturally bestow our first<lb break="yes"/>attention in analysing this volume;
                        although<lb break="yes"/>we must, for this purpose, turn principally to<lb
                        break="yes"/>the copious Appendix, before we attempt re-<lb break="no"
                    />gularly to follow the author through the text<lb break="yes"/>to which that
                    Appendix is annexed.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The twenty-seventh chapter of the tenth<lb break="yes"/>book gives an account of
                    the crossing from the<lb break="yes"/>coast of Venezuela to the Havannah, with
                        a<lb break="yes"/>general view of the population of the Antilles,<lb
                        break="yes"/>or West India Islands, as compared with<lb break="yes"/>that of
                    the whole American continent. This<lb break="yes"/>comparison treats of the
                    diversity of the races of<lb break="yes"/>people, of the degree of personal
                    liberty, of lan-<lb break="no"/>guage, and of religions, which prevail among<lb
                        break="yes"/>them. According to our author&#x2019;s computation,<lb
                        break="yes"/>the whole surface of the West Indian Archipe-<lb break="no"
                    />lago (or, as he more accurately calls it, the<lb break="yes"/>Archipelago of
                    the Antilles) contains about<lb break="yes"/>8,300 square leagues (of twenty to
                    the degree),<lb break="yes"/>of which the four great islands of Cuba, Haiti,<lb
                        break="yes"/>Jamaica, and Porto Rico occupy 7,200, or<lb break="yes"/>about
                    nine-tenths. The area of Insular Equi-<lb break="no"/>noctial America, or, as we
                    should more shortly<lb break="yes"/>phrase it, of the West India Islands,
                        appears,<lb break="yes"/>therefore, to be nearly equal to that of the<lb
                        break="yes"/>Prussian monarchy, and twice as large as that<lb break="yes"
                    />of the state of Pennsylvania. The total popula-<lb break="no"/>tion of these
                    islands is calculated to have been<lb break="yes"/>in 1823 nearly equal to that
                    of Pennsylvania, or<lb break="yes"/>about one third of the population of
                    Scotland.</p>

                <p>&#x201C;We shall soon see independent nations, ruled by very different forms of
                    government, but united by the remembrance of a common origin, the uniformity of
                    language, and the wants to which civilization gives rise, inhabit the two shores
                    of the Atlantic. It may be said, that the immense progress of the art of
                    navigation has narrowed the basin of the seas. The Atlantic Ocean already
                    appears to us in the form of a narrow channel, which as little removes the New
                    World from the commercial states of Europe, as the basin of the Mediterranean,
                    in the infancy of navigation, removed the Greeks of Peloponnesus from those of
                    Ionia, Sicily, and the Cyrene!&#x201D;</p><lb/>
                <p>For our own parts, we prefer M. Humboldt&#x2019;s<lb>facts to the flights of his
                        fancy, and consider</lb><lb>the tables which this volume contains not

                <p>M. de Humboldt details the reasons which<lb>induce him to think that the amount
                        of po-</lb><lb>pulation in this valuation is too low. After a</lb><lb>mature
                        consideration of all the materials in his</lb><lb>possession, he makes the

                        2,785,000</lb><lb>souls; and he thinks it probable that an

                        fact</lb><lb>without pain. Such is the state in which the</lb><lb>colonial

                        left a country</lb><lb>which, for natural riches, rivals all that

                <p>merit (as we stated in noticing the French<lb>edition) consists in the curious

                <p>At setting out we find the author crossing<lb>the Oroonoko for the last time on
                        the Llanos</lb><lb>del Pao, the eastern parts of the plains of
                        Vene-</lb><lb>zuela; thence he visits the missions of the</lb><lb>Caribbees;
                        and leaves the continent after a</lb><lb>short abode on the coast of New
                        Barcelona,</lb><lb>Cumana, and Araya. On the llanos he says:</lb></p><lb/>
                <p>&#x201C;In these equatorial regions, where you can find your course by observing
                    the direction of the clouds, and where the oscillations of the mercury in the
                    barometer indicate the hour almost as well as a clock, every thing is subject to
                    a regular and uniform type. The cessation of the breezes, the beginning of the
                    rainy season, and the frequency of electric explosions, are phenomena, which are
                    found to be connected by immutable laws. </p><lb/>
                <p>&#x201C;At the confluence of the Apure and the Oroonoko, near the mountain of
                    Sacuima, we had met with a French farmer, who lived amid his flocks in the roost
                    absolute seclusion. This was the man, who in his simplicity believed, that the
                    political revolutions of the old world, and the wars which have been the
                    consequence, were owing solely "to the long resistance of the monks of the
                    Observance." We had scarcely entered the Llanos of Nueva Barcelona, when we
                    again found a Frenchman, at whose house we passed the first night, and who
                    received us with the kindest hospitality. He was a native of Lyons; had left his
                    country at a very early age; and appeared extremely indifferent to all that was
                    passing beyond the Atlantic, or, as they say here, disdainfully enough for
                    Europe, "on the other side of the great pool" <hi rend="italic">(del otro lado
                        del charco).</hi> Our host was employed in joining large pieces of wood by
                    means of a kind of glue called <hi rend="italic">guayca.</hi> This substance,
                    used by the carpenters of Angostura, resembles the best glue extracted from the
                    animal kingdom. It is found perfectly prepared between the bark and the alburnum
                    of a creeper<note place="foot" n="*">&#x201C;Combretum <hi rend="italic"
                            >guayca</hi>. It might be thought, that the name of chigommier, given by
                        botanists to the different species of combretum, has an allusion to this
                        glutinous matter; but the name is derived from <hi rend="italic"
                            >chigouma</hi> (combretum laxum, <hi rend="italic">Aubl</hi>.), a word
                        of the Galibi or Caribbee language.&#x201D;</note> of the family of the <hi
                        rend="italic">combretaceæ.</hi> It probably resembles in its chemical
                    properties birdlime, the vegetable principle obtained from the berries of the
                    mistleto, and the internal bark of the holly. An astonishing abundance of this
                    glutinous matter issues from the twining branches of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >vejuco de guayca</hi> when they are cut. Thus, we find within the tropics a
                    substance in a state of purity, and deposited in peculiar organs, which in the
                    temperate zone can be procured only by the processes of art.&#x201D;</p><lb/>
                <p><cb/></p><lb/>
                <p>There is something grotesque as well as<lb/><lb>strange in many of the
                        particulars which at-</lb><lb>tended the travellers in these
                    regions.</lb></p><lb/>
                <p>&#x201C;The humid spots are recognized at a distance by groups of mauritia, which
                    are the sago-trees of those countries. Near the coast this palm-tree constitutes
                    the whole wealth of the Guaraon Indians; and it is somewhat remarkable, that we
                    had found it again one hundred and sixty leagues farther south, in the midst of
                    the forests of the Upper Oroonoko, in the savannahs that surround the granitic
                    peak of Duida. It was loaded at this season with enormous clusters of red fruit,
                    resembling the cones of firs. Our monkeys were extremely fond of this fruit,
                    which has the tsh the clusters, that were suspended over their heads. The plain
                    was undulating from the effect of the <hi rend="italic">mirage</hi>; and when,
                    after travelling for an hour, we arrived at these trunks of the palm-tree, which
                    appeared like masts in the horizon, we observed with astonishment how many
                    things are connected with the existence of a single plant. The winds, losing
                    their velocity when in contact with the foliage and the branches, accumulate
                    sand around the trunk. The smell of the fruit, and the brightness of the
                    verdure, attract from afar the birds of passage, which delight in the vibrating
                    motion of the branches of the palm-tree. A soft murmuring is heard around; and
                    overwhelmed by the heat, and accustomed to the melancholy silence of the
                    steppes, we fancy we enjoy some coolness at, the slightest sound of the foliage.
                    If we examine the soil on the side opposite to the wind, we find it remains
                    humid long after the rainy season. Insects and worms, every where else so rare
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Llanos, </hi>here assemble and multiply. This one
                    solitary and often stunted tree, which would not claim the notice of the
                    traveller amid the forests of the Oroonoko, spreads life around it in the
                    desert. * * * * </p><lb/>
                <p>&#x201C;From the coasts of New California to Valdivia and the mouth of the Rio de
                    la Plata, a space of two thousand leagues, every difficulty of a long journey by
                    land may be surmounted, if the traveller enjoy the protection of the American
                    clergy. The power which this body exercises in the state is too well
                    established, to be soon shaken by a new order of things.</p><lb/>
                <p>At Cari, they came into more common con-<lb>tact with people of the Carib race;
                        and M. de</lb><lb>H. says:</lb></p><lb/>
                <p>&#x201C;It is curious to observe a nomade people, recently attached to the soil,
                    and differing from all the other Indians in their physical and intellectual
                    powers. I have ho where seen a taller race of men (from five feet six inches, to
                    five feet ten inches<note place="foot" n="*">&#x201C;from five feet nine inches,
                        to six feet two inches, English,<lb/>Nearly.&#x201D;</note>), and of a more
                    colossal stature. The men, which is common in America, are more clothed than the
                    women. The latter wear only the <hi rend="italic">guajueo, </hi>or <hi
                        rend="italic">perizoma, </hi>in the form of a band. The men have the lower
                    part of the body as far as the hips wrapped in a piece of blue cloth, so dark as
                    to be almost black. This drapery is so ample, that, when the temperature lowers
                    toward the evening, the Caribbees throw it over their shoulders. Their bodies
                    being tinged with <hi rend="italic">onoto</hi>,<note place="foot" n="&#8224;"
                            >&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Rocou</hi>, obtained from the bixa orellana.
                        The paint<lb>is called in Caribbee <hi rend="italic"
                            >bichet.</hi>&#x201D;</lb></note> their tall figures, of a reddish
                    copper-colour, with their picturesque drapery, projecting from the horizon of
                    the steppe against the sky<lb/>
                    <cb/>as a back ground, resemble antique statues of bronze. The men cut their
                    hair in a very characteristic manner; like the monks, or the children of the
                    choir. A part of the forehead is shaved, which makes it appear extremely large.
                    A large tuft of hair, cut in a circle, begins very near the top of the head.
                    This resemblance of the Caribbees to the monks is not the result of living in
                    the missions; it is not owing, as it has been erroneously asserted, to the
                    desire of the natives to imitate their masters, the fathers of the order of
                    Saint Francis. The tribes, that have preserved their savage independance,
                    between the sources of the Carony and the Rio Branco, are distinguished by the
                    same <hi rend="italic">cerquillo de frailes, </hi>which the first Spanish
                    historians at the time of the discovery of America attributed to the nations of
                    Caribbee origin. All the men of this race, whom we saw either during our voyage
                    on the Lower Oroonoko, or in the missions of Piritoo, differ from the other
                    Indians not only by their tallness, but also by the regularity of their
                    features. Their nose is not so large, and less flattened; the cheek-bones are
                    not so high; and their physiognomy has less of the Mongul cast. Their eyes,
                    darker than those of the other hordes of Guyana, denote intelligence, I had
                    almost said the habit of reflexion. The Caribbees have a gravity in their
                    manners, and something of sadness in their look, which is found for the most
                    part among the primitive inhabitants of the New World. The expression of
                    severity in their features is singularly increased by the rage they have for
                    dying their eyebrows with the juice of the caruto, enlarging them, and joining
                    them together. They often mark the whole face with black spots, in order to
                    appear more savage. The magistrates of the place, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Governador </hi>and the <hi rend="italic">Alcades, </hi>who alone have the
                    privilege of carrying long canes, came to visit us. Among them were some young
                    Indians from eighteen to twenty years of age, the choice depending solely on the
                    will of the missionary. We were struck at finding among these Caribbees painted
                    with arnotta the same airs of importance, the stiff mien, and the cold and
                    disdainful manners, which are sometimes to be met with among people in office,
                    in the old continent. The Caribbee women are less robust, and uglier than the
                    men. On them devolves almost the whole burden of domestic labours, no well as
                    those of the fields. They asked us with earnestness for pins; which, having no
                    pockets, they placed under the lower lip, piercing the skin, so that the head of
                    the pin remained within the mouth. The young girls are dyed with red; and,
                    except the <hi rend="italic">guajuco, </hi>are naked. Among the different
                    nations of the two worlds the idea of nudity is altogether relative. A woman in
                    some parts of Asia is not permitted to show the end of her fingers; while an
                    Indian of the Caribbee race is far from considering herself as naked, when she
                    wears a <hi rend="italic">guajuco </hi>two inches broad. Even this band is
                    regarded as a less essential part of dress than the pigment, which covers the
                    skin. To go out of the hut without being painted with arnotta, is to transgress
                    all the rules of Caribbean decency.&#x201D;</p><lb/>
                <p>After some discussion on North and South<lb>American antiquities, language,
                        &amp;c., M. de</lb><lb>H. continues:</lb></p><lb/>
                <p>&#x201C;The missionary led us into several Indian huts, where an extreme neatness
                    and order prevailed. We saw with pain the torments, which the Caribbee mothers
                    inflict on their infants, in order not only to enlarge the calf of the leg, but
                    to raise the flesh in alternate stripes from the ankle to the top of the thighs. Bands<lb/>
                    <pb n="182" facs="#f0007"/> of leather, or of woven cotton, are placed like
                    narrow ligatures at two or three inches distant; and being tightened more and
                    more, the muscles between the bands become swelled. Our infants when swaddled
                    suffer much less than these Caribbee children, in a nation which is said to be
                    so much nearer a state of nature. In vain the monks of the missions, without
                    knowing the works or the name of Rousseau, attempt to oppose this ancient system
                    of physical education. Man when just issued from the woods, and who is thought
                    to be so simple in his manners, is far from being docile with respect to his
                    ornaments, and the ideas which he has formed of beauty and propriety. I observed
                    however with surprise, that the manner in which these poor children are bound,
                    and which seems to obstruct the circulation of the blood, does not weaken their
                    muscular movements. There is no race of men more robust, and swifter in running,
                    than the Caribbees. </p><lb/>
                <p>&#x201C;If the women labour to form the legs and thighs of their children so as
                    to produce what the painters call undulating outlines, they abstain, at least in
                    the Llanos, from flattening the head, by compressing it between cushions and
                    planks from the most tender age. This usage, so common heretofore in the
                    islands, and among several tribes of the Caribbees of Parima and French Guyana,
                    is not practised in the missions which we visited.&#x201D;</p><lb/>
                <p>M. de H. assures us, that the Caribbees, so<lb/><lb>far from being, as usually
                        supposed, cannibals,</lb><lb>are the least anthropophagous nations of
                        the</lb><lb>New Continent: where civilised by the mis-</lb><lb>sions they
                        are eloquent in an extraordinary</lb><lb>degree, and</lb></p><lb/>
                <p>&#x201C;The whole village assembles on holidays before the church, after the
                    celebration of mass. The young girls place at the feet of the missionary faggots
                    of wood, bunches of plantains, and other provision of which he stands in need
                    for his household. At the same time the <hi rend="italic">governador, </hi>the
                        <hi rend="italic">fiscal, </hi>and other municipal officers, all of whom are
                    Indians, exhort the natives to labour, proclaim the occupations of the ensuing
                    week, reprimand the idle, and, since it must be told, severely cudgel the
                    untractable. The strokes of the cane are received with the same insensibility
                    with which they are given. These acts of distributive justice appear very long
                    and frequent to travellers, who cross the Llanos in their way from Angostura to
                    the coasts. It were to be wished, that the priest did not dictate these corporal
                    punishments at the instant of quitting the altar, and that he were not in his
                    sacerdotal habits the spectator of this chastisement of men and women; but this
                    abuse, or, if the reader prefer the term, this want of propriety, arises from
                    the principle on which the strange government of the missions is founded. The
                    most arbitrary civil power is strictly connected with the rights, which the
                    priest exerts over the little community; and, although the Caribbees are not <hi
                        rend="italic">cannibals, </hi>and we would wish to see them treated with
                    mildness and indulgence, it may be conceived, that energetic measures are
                    sometimes necessary, to maintain tranquillity in this rising society. * * *</p><lb/>
                <p>&#x201C;The chiefs of the independant Caribbees are hereditary in the male line
                    only, the children of sisters being excluded from the succession. This is
                    founded on a system of mistrust, which denotes no great purity of manners; it is
                    the custom of India, of the Ashantees (in Africa), and among several tribes of
                    the savages of North America. The young chiefs, like the youths who are desirous
                    of marrying, are<lb/><cb/>subjected to the most extraordinary fasts and
                    penances. They are purged with the fruit of some of the euphorbiaceæ; are
                    sweated in stoves; and take medicines prepared by the <hi rend="italic">marirris
                    </hi>or <hi rend="italic">Piaches, </hi>which are called in the transalleghanian
                    countries <hi rend="italic">war-physick. </hi>The Caribbee <hi rend="italic"
                        >marirris </hi>are the most celebrated of all: at once priests, jugglers,
                    and physicians, they transmit to their successors their doctrine, their
                    artifices, and the remedies they employ. The latter are accompanied with laying
                    on of hands, and certain gestures and mysterious practices, which appear to be
                    connected with the most anciently known processes of animal
                    magnetism.&#x201D;</p><lb/>
                <p>Leaving the mission of Cari, the author<lb>states&#x2014;</lb></p><lb/>
                <p>&#x201C;We had two bad stations, at Matagorda and at Los Riecetos, before we
                    reached the little town of Pao. We met every where with the same objects; small
                    huts constructed of reeds, and roofed with leather; men on horseback armed with
                    lances guarding the herds; herds of cattle half wild, remarkable for their
                    uniform colour, and disputing the pasturage with the horses and mules. No sheep
                    or goats are found on these immense steppes! Sheep do not breed kindly in
                    equinoctial America, except on the table-lands above a thousand toises high,
                    where their fleece is long, and sometimes very fine. In the ardent climate of
                    the plains, where the wolves give place to jaguars, these small ruminating
                    animals, destitute of means of defence, and so slow in their movements, are
                    unable to preserve themselves in great numbers. * * *</p><lb/>
                <p>&#x201C;Since we had reached the middle of the steppes, the heat had increased to
                    such a degree, that we should have preferred travelling no more during the day;
                    but we were without arms, and the <hi rend="italic">llanos </hi>were then
                    infested by an immense number of robbers, who assassinated the whites that fell
                    into their hands with an atrocious refinement of cruelty. Nothing is more
                    deplorable than the administration of justice in the colonies beyond sea. We
                    every where found the prisons filled with malefactors, on whom sentence is not
                    passed till after waiting seven or eight years. Nearly a third of the prisoners
                    succeed in making their escape; and the unpeopled plains, filled with herds,
                    afford them both an asylum and food. They commit their depredations on
                    horseback, in the manner of the Bedoweens. The insalubrity of the prisons would
                    be at its height, if they were not emptied from time to time by the flight of
                    the prisoners. It often happens also, that sentences of death, tardily
                    pronounced by the <hi rend="italic">audiencia </hi>of Caraccas, cannot be
                    executed for want of a hangman. In these cases a barbarous custom prevails,
                    which I have already mentioned, of pardoning one criminal on the condition of
                    his hanging the others. Our guides related to us, that a short time before our
                    arrival on the coast of Cumana, a Zambo, known for the great ferocity of his
                    manners, determined to screen himself from punishment by becoming the
                    executioner. The preparations for the execution however shook his resolution; he
                    felt a horror of himself, and, preferring death to the disgrace of thus saving
                    his life, called again for his irons, which had been struck off. He did not long
                    suffer detention, and underwent his sentence by the baseness of one of his
                    accomplices. This awakening of a sentiment of honour in the soul of a murderer
                    is a psychologic phenomenon worthy of reflection. The man, who had so often shed
                    blood when stripping the traveller in the steppe, recoiled at the idea of
                    becoming the<lb/>
                    <cb/> passive instrument of justice, to inflict upon others a punishment, which
                    he felt perhaps he himself deserved. * * *</p><lb/>
                <p>&#x201C;Our wastes and heaths are but a feeble image of the savannahs of the New
                    Continent, which for the space of eight or ten thousand square leagues are
                    smooth as the surface of the sea. The immensity of their extent insures impunity
                    to vagabonds; for they are better concealed in the savannahs than in our
                    mountains and forests; and it is easy to conceive, that the artifices of a
                    European police could not be easily put in practice, where there are travellers
                    and no roads, herds and no herdsmen, and farms so solitary, that,
                    notwithstanding the powerful action of the <hi rend="italic">mirage,
                    </hi>several days' journey may be made without seeing one appear within the
                    horizon.&#x201D;</p><lb/>
                <p>At length the party arrived at Neuva Bar-<lb>celona, and the following curious
                        scientific ob-</lb><lb>servation is made:&#x2014;</lb></p><lb/>
                <p>&#x201C;As we advanced, the sky became more serene, the soil more dusty, and the
                    atmosphere more fiery. The heat, from which we suffered, is not entirely owing
                    to the temperature of the air, but is produced by the fine sand mingled with it,
                    that darts in every direction, and strikes against the face of the traveller, as
                    it does against the ball of the thermometer. I never observed however the
                    mercury rise in America, amid a <hi rend="italic">wind of sand, </hi>above 45·8°
                    cent. Captain Lyon, with whom I had the pleasure of an interview on his return
                    from Mourzouk, appeared to me also inclined to think, that the temperature of
                    fifty-two degrees, which is so often felt in Fezzan, is produced in great part
                    by the grains of quartz suspended in the atmosphere.&#x201D;</p><lb/>
                <p>At Barcelona Messrs. De H. and Bonpland<lb>remained about a month, and were most
                        hos-</lb><lb>pitably reated. During that time they visited</lb><lb>some
                        copious hot-springs, at the distance</lb><lb>of two leagues, and situated in
                        the lofty moun-</lb><lb>tain chain of Bergantin.</lb></p><lb/>
                <p>&#x201C;The waters, loaded with sulphuretted hydrogen, issue from a quartzous
                    sandstone, lying on the same compact limestone, which we had examined at the
                    Morro. We again found in this limestone intercalated beds of black hornstein,
                    passing into <hi rend="italic">kieselschiefer. </hi>It is not however a
                    transition rock..... The thermal waters have only a temperature of 43·2° cent.
                    (the atmosphere being 27°); they flow first to the distance of forty toises over
                    the rocky surface of the ground; are then precipitated into a natural cavern;
                    and pierce through the limestone, to issue out at the foot of the mountain, on
                    the left bank of the little river Narigual. The springs, while in contact with
                    the oxygen of the atmosphere, deposit a good deal of sulphur.&#x201D;</p><lb/>
                <p>A remarkable adventure terminated this ex-<lb/>cursion.</p><lb/>
                <p>&#x201C;Our host (says the narrator) had lent us one of his finest saddle horses.
                    We were warned at the same time not to ford the little river of Narigual. We
                    passed over a sort of bridge, or rather some trunks of trees placed close
                    together, and we made our horses swim, holding their bridles. The horse I had
                    rode suddenly disappeared, after struggling for some time under water: all our
                    researches to discover the cause of this accident were fruitless. Our guides
                    conjectured, that the animal's legs had been seized by the <hi rend="italic"
                        >caymans, </hi>which abound in those parts. My perplexity was extreme: the
                    delicacy and the fortune of my host forbade me to think of repairing his loss;
                    and Mr. Lavie, more attentive to our situation, than to the fate of his horse,
                    endeavoured to tranquillize<lb/>
                    <pb n="183" facs="#f0008"/> us by exaggerating the facility, with which fine
                    horses were procurable from the neighbouring savannahs. </p><lb/>
                <p>&#x201C;The crocodiles of the Rio Neveri are large and numerous, especially near
                    the mouth of the river; but in general they are less fierce than the crocodiles
                    of the Oroonoko. These animals display the same contrasts of ferocity in America
                    as in Egypt and Nubia, which we recognize when we compare with attention the
                    narrative of the unfortunate Burckhardt, and that of Mr. Belzoni. The state of
                    cultivation of different countries, and the population more or less accumulated
                    in the proximity of rivers, modify the habits of these large <hi rend="italic"
                        >sauriens, </hi>timid when on dry ground, and fleeing from man even in the
                    water, when they find abundant nourishment, and when they perceive any danger in
                    attacking him.&#x201D;</p><lb/>
                <p>In sailing to Cumana the travellers were<lb>taken by a piratical privateer, and
                        only saved</lb><lb>from plunder, perhaps from death, by
                        the</lb><lb>opportune heaving in sight of the British</lb><lb>sloop, Hawk,
                        Capt. Garnier, who recused and</lb><lb>conducted them in safety to their
