                    <p>The following abstract of the American Travels<lb break="yes"/>of the celebrated Baron <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName> and his com-<lb break="no"/>panion <persName key="bonpland_ajag" >Bonpland</persName>, has been drawn up from notes<lb break="yes"/>which the former has kindly furnished, and will<lb break="yes"/>supersede the many very incorrect accounts hither-<lb break="no"/>to published relative to this interesting object.</p>
                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>Baron <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName>, having travelled from the<lb break="yes"/>year 1790, as a naturalist, through Germany, Po-<lb break="no"/>land, France, Switzerland, and through parts of<lb break="yes"/>England, Italy, Hungary, and Spain, came to<lb break="yes" />Paris in 1798, when he received an invitation,<lb break="yes"/>from the directors of the national museum, to ac-<lb break="no"/>company captain <persName key="baudin_tn">Baudin</persName> in his voyage round the<lb break="yes"/>world. Citizen <persName key="bonpland_ajag">Alexander Aime Gourjon Bon-<lb break="no"/>pland</persName>, a native of Rochelle, and brought up in<lb break="yes"/>the Paris museum, was also to have accompanied<lb break="yes"/>them; when on the point of departing, the<lb break="yes"/>whole plan was suspended until a more favorable<lb break="yes"/>opportunity, owing to the re-commencement of<lb break="yes" />the war with Austria, and to the consequent want<lb break="yes"/>of funds.</p>
                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName>, who, from 1792, had conceiv-<lb break="no"/>ed the plan of travelling through India at his own<lb break="yes"/>expence, with a view of adding to the knowledge<lb break="yes"/>of the sciences connected with natural history,<lb break="yes"/>then resolved to follow the learned men, who had<lb break="yes"/>gone on the expedition to <placeName key="aegypten" >Egypt</placeName>. His plan was<lb break="yes"/>to go to <placeName key="algier">Algiers</placeName> in the Swedish frigate which car-<lb break="no"/>ried the consul <persName key="skjoldebrand_ma" >Skoldebrandt</persName>, to follow the cara-<lb break="no"/>van which goes from <placeName key="algier">Algiers</placeName> to Mecca, going<lb break="yes"/>through <placeName key="aegypten">Egypt</placeName> to <placeName key="arabien">Arabia</placeName>, and thence by the Per-<lb break="no"/>sian gulph to the English East-India establish-<lb break="no"/>ments. The war which unexpectedly broke out<lb break="yes" />in October, 1798, between France and the Bar-<lb break="no"/>bary powers, and the troubles in the East, pre-<lb break="no"/>vented Mr. <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName> from embarking at Mar-<lb break="no"/>seilles, where he had been fruitlessly two months<lb break="yes"/>waiting to proceed. Impatient at this delay, and<lb break="yes"/>continuing firm in his determination to go to<lb break="yes"/>
                        <placeName key="aegypten">Egypt</placeName>, he went to Spain, hoping to pass more<lb break="yes"/>readily under the Spanish flag from Carthagena to<lb break="yes"/>
                        <placeName key="algier">Algiers</placeName> and Tunis. He took with him the large<lb break="yes"/>collection of philosophical, chemical, and astro-<lb break="no"/>nomical instruments, which he had purchased in<lb break="yes"/>England and France.</p>
                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>From a happy concurrence of circumstances,<lb break="yes"/>he obtained, in February, <choice><sic>1789</sic><corr type="editorial">1799</corr></choice>, from the court<lb break="yes"/>of Madrid, a permission to visit the <placeName key="spanischeskolonialreich">Spanish co-<lb break="no" />lonies of the two Americas</placeName>, a permission which<lb break="yes"/>was granted with a liberality and frankness, which<lb break="yes"/>was honorable to the government and to a philo-<lb break="no"/>sophic age. After a residence of some months at<lb break="yes"/>the Spanish court, during which time the king<lb break="yes"/>showed a strong personal interest in the plan, Mr.<lb break="yes"/>
                        <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName>, in June, 1799, left Europe, accom-<lb break="no"/>panied by Mr. <persName key="bonpland_ajag" >Bonpland</persName>, who, to a profound<lb break="yes"/>knowledge in botany and zoology, added an in-<lb break="no"/>defatigable zeal. It is with this friend that Mr.<lb break="yes"/>
                        <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName> has accomplished, at his own expence,<lb break="yes"/>his travels in the two hemispheres, by land and<lb break="yes"/>sea, probably the most extensive which any <hi rendition="#i">indi-<lb break="no"/>vidual</hi> has ever undertaken.</p>
                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>These two travellers left <placeName key="acoruna">Corunna</placeName> in the

                        experiments on the analysis of the air. In<lb break="yes"/>July they arrived

                        commenced. He flattered<lb break="yes"/>himself that his researches, and

                        <persName key="bonpland_ajag">Bonpland</persName>, might be more useful to

                    <p>These considerations induced Mr. <persName key="humboldt_av" >Humboldt</persName> to<lb break="yes"/>send his manuscripts, for 1799 and 1800, direct<lb break="yes"/>to Europe, and to freight a small schooner at Ban-<lb break="no"/>tabano, intending to go to Carthagena, and from<lb break="yes"/>thence, as quickly as possible, by the Isthmus of<lb break="yes"/>Panama, to the South Sea.

                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>It appeared imprudent to expose the manuscripts<lb break="yes"/>and collections already made to the risks of this<lb break="yes"/>proposed navigation. These manuscripts, of the<lb break="yes"/>fate of which Mr. H. remained ignorant during<lb break="yes"/>three years, and until his arrival in Philadelphia,<lb break="yes"/>arrived safe, but one third part of the collection was<lb break="yes"/>lost by shipwreck.

                    <p>Circumstances were so favorable to the efforts of<lb break="yes"/>the three

                            ascended<lb break="yes"/>2200 French feet, and at Chimborazo, on June

                        from their eyes, lips, and gums. An open-<lb break="no"/>ing, of 80 toises
                        deep, and very wide, prevented<lb break="yes"/>them from reaching the top,

                        received a<lb break="yes"/>letter from the National Institute of France,

                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>After having examined the country overturned<lb break="yes"/>by the

                        />France, and which went upon the ridge of the<lb break="yes"/>

                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>They descended the river Chamaya, which led<lb break="yes"/>them into that of
                        the <placeName key="amazonas">Amazons</placeName>, and they navigated<lb
                            break="yes"/>this last river down to the cataracts of Tomeperda,<lb

                        at seven degrees of south<lb break="yes"/>latitude. They visited the mines
                        of Hualguayoc,<lb break="yes"/>where native silver is found at the height of
                            2000<lb break="yes"/>toises. Some of the veins of these mines contain<lb
                            break="yes"/>petrified shells, and which, with those of Pasco<lb
                            break="yes"/>and Huantajayo, are actually the richest of Peru.<lb
                            break="yes"/>From Caxamarca they descended to Truxillo, in<lb
                            break="yes"/>the neighbourhood of which are found the ruins of<lb

                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>It was on this western descent of the <placeName key="anden"
                            >Andes</placeName> that<lb break="yes"/>the three voyagers, for the

                        They followed<lb break="yes"/>its barren sides, formerly watered by the
                        canals of<lb break="yes"/>the Yngas at Santa, Guerma, and Lima. They re-<lb
                            break="no"/>mained some months in this interesting capital of<lb
                            break="yes"/>Peru, of which the inhabitants are distinguished<lb
                            break="yes"/>by the vivacity of their genius, and the liberality<lb
                            break="yes"/>of their ideas.</p>
                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName> had the good fortune to
                            observe<lb break="yes"/>the end of the passage of Mercury over the
                            sun&#x2019;s<lb break="yes"/>disk, in the port of Callao. He was
                        astonished to<lb break="yes"/>find, at such a distance from Europe, the most
                            re-<lb break="no"/>cent productions in chemistry, mathematics, and<lb
                            break="yes"/>medicine; and he found great activity of mind in<lb
                            break="yes"/>
                        <cb/> the inhabitants, who, in a climate where it never<lb break="yes"
                        />either rains or thunders, have been falsely accused<lb break="yes"/>of
                        indolence.</p>
                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>From Lima our travellers passed by sea to Gua-<lb break="no"/>yaquil,
                        situated on the brink of a river, where the<lb break="yes"/>growth of the
                        palm-tree is beautiful beyond des-<lb break="no"/>cription. They every
                        moment heard the rumbling<lb break="yes"/>of the volcano of Cotopaxi, which
                        made an alarm-<lb break="no"/>ing explosion on the 6th of January, 1803.
                            They<lb break="yes"/>immediately set off to visit it a second time,
                            when<lb break="yes"/>the unexpected intelligence of the speedy depar-<lb
                            break="no"/>ture of the frigate Atalanta determined them to<lb
                            break="yes"/>return, after being seven days exposed to the<lb
                            break="yes"/>dreadful attacks of the mosquitoes of <placeName

                        <lb break="yes"/>and Ujibar.</p>
                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>They had a fortunate passage, by the Pacific<lb break="yes"/>Ocean, to
                            <placeName key="acapulco">Acapulco</placeName>, the western port of the

                            break="yes"/>harbour, which appears to have been formed by<lb
                            break="yes"/>earthquakes, for the misery of its inhabitants, and<lb
                            break="yes"/>for its climate, which is equally hot and un-<lb break="no"
                        />healthy.</p>
                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName> had originally the
                        intention to re-<lb break="no"/>main only a few months in Mexico, and to
                            hasten<lb break="yes"/>his return to Europe; his voyage had already
                            been<lb break="yes"/>too much protracted, his instruments,
                            particularly<lb break="yes"/>the chronometer, began to be out of order,
                            and<lb break="yes"/>every effort that he made to have new ones sent
                            to<lb break="yes"/>him proved of no avail; add to this considera-<lb
                            break="no"/>tion, that the progress of science is so rapid in Eu-<lb
                            break="no"/>rope, that, in a journey that lasts four or five years,<lb
                            break="yes"/>great risk is run of contemplating the different<lb
                            break="yes"/>phenomena under aspects which are no longer in-<lb
                            break="no"/>teresting at the moment of publishing the result of<lb
                            break="yes"/>your labours. Mr. <persName key="humboldt_av"
                            >Humboldt</persName> hoped to be in France<lb break="yes"/>in August or
                        September, 1803; but the at-<lb break="no"/>tractions of a country, so
                        beautiful and so varied,<lb break="yes"/>as is that of the kingdom of New
                        Spain, the great<lb break="yes"/>hospitality of its inhabitants, and the
                        fear of the<lb break="yes"/>yellow fever, fatal from June to November,
                            for<lb break="yes"/>those who come from the mountainous parts of the<lb
                            break="yes"/>country, led him to stay a year in this kingdom.</p>
                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>Our travellers ascended from <placeName key="acapulco">Acapulco</placeName>
                        to Tasco,<lb break="yes"/>celebrated for its mines, as interesting as they
                            are<lb break="yes"/>ancient. They rise, by small degrees, from the<lb
                            break="yes"/>ancient valley of Mescala and Papagayo, where<lb
                            break="yes"/>the thermometer of <persName key="reaumur_rafd"
                            >Reaumur</persName> stands, in the shade,<lb break="yes"/>constantly
                        from 28 to 31 (95 to 101 Fahr.) in a<lb break="yes"/>region 6 or 700 toises
                        above the level of the sea,<lb break="yes"/>where you find the oaks, the
                        pines, and the fou-<lb break="no"/>gere, (fern) as large as trees, and where
                        the Eur-<lb break="no"/>opean grains are cultivated. They passed by<lb
                            break="yes"/>Tasco, by Cuerna Vacca, to the capital of Mexi-<lb
                            break="no"/>co. This city, of 150,000 inhabitants, is placed<lb
                            break="yes"/>upon the ancient scite of Texochtitlan, between<lb
                            break="yes"/>the lakes of Tezcuco and Xochimilco, lakes which<lb
                            break="yes"/>have lessened somewhat since the Spaniards have<lb
                            break="yes"/>opened the canal of Hacheutoca, in sight of two<lb
                            break="yes"/>snow-topped mountains, of which one, Hopoca-<lb break="no"
                        />tepec, is even now an active volcano, surrounded<lb break="yes"/>by a
                        great number of walks, shaded with trees,<lb break="yes"/>and by Indian
                        villages.</p>
                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>This capital of Mexico, situated 1160 toises<lb break="yes"/>above the sea,
                        in a mild and temperate climate,<lb break="yes"/>may doubtless be compared
                        to some of the finest<lb break="yes"/>towns in Europe. Great scientific
                            establishments,<lb break="yes"/>such as the Academy of Painting,
                        Sculpture, and<lb break="yes"/>Engraving, the College of Mines, (owing to
                            the<lb break="yes"/>liberality of the Company of Miners of Mexico),<lb
                            break="yes"/>and the Botanic Garden, are institutions which<lb
                            break="yes"/>do honour to the government which has created<lb
                            break="yes"/>them.</p>
                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>After remaining some months in the valley of<lb break="yes"/>Mexico, and
                        after fixing the longitude of the<lb break="yes"/>capital, which had been
                        laid down with an error<lb break="yes"/>of nearly two degrees, our
                        travellers visited the<lb break="yes"/>mines of Moran and Real del Monte,
                        and the<lb break="yes"/>Cerro of Oyamel, where the ancient Mexicans had<lb
                            break="yes"/>the manufactory of knives made of the obsidian<lb
                            break="yes"/>stone. They soon after passed by Queretaro and<lb
                            break="yes"/>Salamanca to Guanaxoato, a town of fifty thousand<lb
