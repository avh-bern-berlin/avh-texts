                <p>Baron <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName>, having travelled from<lb break="yes"/>the year 1790, as a naturalist, through Ger-<lb break="no" />many, Poland, France, Switzerland, and<lb break="yes"/>through parts of England, Italy, Hungary,<lb break="yes"/>and Spain, came to Paris in 1798, when he<lb break="yes"/>received an invitation, from the directors of<lb break="yes"/>the national museum, to accompany captain<lb break="yes"/>
                    <persName key="baudin_tn">Baudin</persName> in his voyage round the world.&#x2014;<lb break="yes"/>Citizen <persName key="bonpland_ajag" >Alexander Aime Goujon Bonpland</persName>,<lb break="yes"/>a native of Rochelle, and brought up in the<lb break="yes"/>Paris museum, was also to have accompani-<lb break="no"/>ed them; when on the point of departing,<lb break="yes"/>the whole plan was suspended until a more<lb break="yes" />favourable opportunity, owing to the re-<lb break="no"/>commencement of the war with Austria, and<lb break="yes"/>to the consequent want of funds.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Mr. <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName>, who, from 1792, had con-<lb break="no"/>ceived the plan of travelling through India<lb break="yes"/>at his own expence, with a view of adding<lb break="yes"/>to the knowledge of the sciences connected<lb break="yes"/>with natural history, then resolved to follow<lb break="yes"/>the learned men, who had gone on the expe-<lb break="no"/>dition to <placeName key="aegypten" >Egypt</placeName>.&#x2014;His plan was to go to Al-<lb break="no"/>giers in the Swedish frigate which carried<lb break="yes"/>the consul <persName key="skjoldebrand_ma">Skoldebrandt</persName>, to follow the cara-<lb break="no"/>van which goes from <placeName key="algier">Algiers</placeName> to Mecca, go-<lb break="no"/>ing through <placeName key="aegypten" >Egypt</placeName> to <placeName key="arabien">Arabia</placeName>, and thence by<lb break="yes"/>the Persian gulph to the English East-India<lb break="yes"/>establishments. The war which unexpect-<lb break="no"/>edly broke out in October 1798, between<lb break="yes"/>France and the Barbary powers, and the<lb break="yes"/>troubles in the East, prevented Mr. Hum-<lb break="no"/>boldt from embarking at Marseilles, where he<lb break="yes"/>had been fruitlessly two months waiting to<lb break="yes"/>proceed. Impatient at this delay, and con-<lb break="no"/>tinuing firm in his determination to go to<lb break="yes"/>
                    <placeName key="aegypten">Egypt</placeName>, he went to Spain, hoping to pass<lb break="yes"/>more readily under the Spanish flag from<lb break="yes" />Carthagena to <placeName key="algier">Algiers</placeName> and Tunis. He took<lb break="yes"/>with him the large collection of philosophi-<lb break="no"/>cal, chemical, and astronomical instruments,<lb break="yes" />which he had purchased in England and<lb break="yes"/>France.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>From a happy concurrence of circum-<lb break="no"/>stances, he obtained, in February, 1799,<lb break="yes"/>from the court of Madrid, a permission to<lb break="yes"/>visit the Spanish colonies of the two Ameri-<lb break="no" />cas, a permission which was granted with a<lb break="yes"/>liberality and frankness, which was honour-<lb break="no"/>able to the government and to a philosophic<lb break="yes"/>age. After a residence of some months at<lb break="yes"/>the Spanish court, during which time the<lb break="yes"/>king showed a strong personal interest in the<lb break="yes"/>plan, Mr. <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName>, in June, 1799, left Eu-<lb break="no" />rope, accompanied by Mr. <persName key="bonpland_ajag">Bonpland</persName>, who,<lb break="yes"/>to a profound knowledge in botany and zoo-<lb break="no"/>logy, added an indefatigable zeal. It is with<lb break="yes" />this friend that Mr. <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName> has accom-<lb break="no"/>plished, at his own expence, his travels in the<lb break="yes"/>two hemispheres, by land and sea, probably<lb break="yes"/>the most extensive which any <hi rendition="#i">individual</hi> has<lb break="yes" />ever undertaken.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>These two travellers left <placeName key="acoruna">Corunna</placeName> in the<lb break="yes"/>Spanish ship <persName key="pizzaro_f">Pizarro</persName>, for the Canary islands,<lb break="yes"/>where they ascended to the crater of the Peak<lb break="yes"/>of Teyde, and made experiments on the ana-<lb break="no"/>lysis of the air. In July they arrived at the<lb break="yes" />port of Cumana, in <placeName key="suedamerika">South America</placeName>. In<lb break="yes"/>1799, 1800, they visited the coast of Paria,<lb break="yes"/>the missions of the Chaymas Indians, the<lb break="yes" />provinces of New Andalusia (a country<lb break="yes"/>which had been rent by the most dreadful<lb break="yes"/>earthquakes, the hottest, and yet the most<lb break="yes"/>healthy, in the world) of <placeName key="barcelona">New Barcelona</placeName>, of<lb break="yes"/>Venezuela, and of Spanish Guayana.&#x2014;In<lb break="yes"/>January, 1800, they left Caraccas to visit<lb break="yes"/>the beautiful vallies of <placeName key="aragua" >Aragua</placeName>, where the<lb break="yes"/>great lake of Valencia recals to the mind the<lb break="yes"/>views of the lake of Geneva, embellished by<lb break="yes"/>the majesty of the vegetation of the tropics.<lb break="yes" />From Porto Cabello they crossed, to the<lb break="yes"/>south, the immense plains of Calabozo, of<lb break="yes"/>
                    <placeName key="apure">Apure</placeName>, and of the Oronoco, also los Lla-<lb break="no"/>nos, a desert similar to those of <placeName key="afrika" >Africa</placeName>, where<lb break="yes"/>in the shade (by the reverberation of heat)<lb break="yes"/>the thermometer of <persName key="reaumur_rafd">Reaumur</persName> rose to 35 and<lb break="yes"/>37 (111 to 115 F.) degrees. The level of<lb break="yes"/>the country for 2000 square leagues does<lb break="yes"/>not differ 5 inches. The sand every where<lb break="yes"/>represents the horizon of the sea, without ve-<lb break="no" />getation; and its dry bosom hides the cro-<lb break="no"/>codiles, and the torpid boa (a species of ser-<lb break="no"/>pent.) The travelling here, as in all <placeName key="spanischeskolonialreich">Spanish<lb break="yes" />America</placeName>, except Mexico, is performed on<lb break="yes" />horseback.&#x2014;They passed whole days with-<lb break="no"/>out seeing a palm-tree or the vestige of a<lb break="yes"/>human dwelling. At <placeName key="sanfernandodeapure">St. Fernando de A-<lb break="no"/>pure</placeName>, in the provinces of <placeName key="varinas">Varinas</placeName>, Messrs.<lb break="yes"/>
                    <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName> and <persName key="bonpland_ajag">Bonpland</persName> began that fatigu-<lb break="no" />ing navigation of nearly 1000 marine leagues<lb break="yes"/>executed in canoes, making a chart of the<lb break="yes"/>country by the assistance of chronometers,<lb break="yes"/>the satellites of Jupiter, and the lunar dis-<lb break="no"/>tances. They descended the <placeName key="apure">river Apure</placeName>,<lb break="yes"/>which empties itself into the Oronoco, in 7<lb break="yes"/>degrees of latitude. They ascended the last<lb break="yes" />river (passing the celebrated cataracts of<lb break="yes"/>Maypure and <placeName key="atures">Atures</placeName>) to the mouth of the<lb break="yes"/>Guaviare. From thence they ascended the<lb break="yes"/>small rivers of <placeName key="atabapo">Tabapa</placeName>, Juamini, and Temi.<lb break="yes"/>From the mission of Sarita they crossed by<lb break="yes"/>land to the sources of the famous Rio Negro,<lb break="yes"/>which <persName key="lacondamine_cmd">Condamine</persName> saw, where it joins the<lb break="yes"/>
                    <placeName key="amazonas">Amazon</placeName>, and which he calls a sea of fresh<lb break="yes"/>water. About 30 Indians carried the ca-<lb break="no" />noes through woods of Mami, Lecythis, and<lb break="yes"/>Laurus Cinamomoides, to the cano (or<lb break="yes"/>creek) of Pimichin. It was by this small<lb break="yes"/>stream that the travellers entered the Rio<lb break="yes" />Negro, or Black River, which they descend-<lb break="no"/>ed to St. Carlos, which has been erroneous-<lb break="no"/>ly supposed to be placed under the <placeName key="aequator">equator</placeName>,<lb break="yes"/>or just at the frontiers of Great Para, in the<lb break="yes"/>government of Brasil. A canal from Temi<lb break="yes"/>to Pimichin, which from the level nature of<lb break="yes"/>the ground is very practicable, would present<lb break="yes"/>a fine internal communication between the<lb break="yes"/>Para and the province of Carracas, a com-<lb break="no"/>munication infinitely shorter than that of Cas-<lb break="no"/>siquiare.&#x2014;From the fortress of St. Carlos on<lb break="yes"/>the Rio Negro, Mr. H. went north up that<lb break="yes"/>river and the Cassiquiare to the Oronoco,<lb break="yes"/>and on this river to the volcano Daida or the<lb break="yes"/>mission of the Esmeralda, near the sources of<lb break="yes"/>the Oronoco: the Indians Guaicas (a race<lb break="yes" />of men almost pigmies, very white and very<lb break="yes"/>warlike) render fruitless any attempts to<lb break="yes"/>reach the sources themselves.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>From the Esmeralda Messrs. H. and B.<lb break="yes"/>went down the Oronoco, when the waters<lb break="yes"/>rose, towards its mouths at St. Thomas de la<lb break="yes"/>Guayana, or the <placeName key="angostura" >Angostura</placeName>. It was dur-<lb break="no"/>ing this long navigation that they were in a<lb break="yes"/>continued state of suffering, from want of<lb break="yes"/>nourishment and shelter, from the night<lb break="yes" />rains, from living in the woods, from the<lb break="yes"/>mosquetoes, and an infinite variety of sting-<lb break="no"/>ing insects, and from the impossibility of<lb break="yes"/>bathing, owing to the fierceness of the croco-<lb break="no"/>dile and the little carib fish, and finally the<lb break="yes"/>miasmata of a burning climate. They re-<lb break="no"/>turned to Cumana by the plains of Cari and<lb break="yes"/>the mission of the Carib Indians, a race of<lb break="yes"/>men very different from any other, and pro-<lb break="no"/>bably, after the Patagonians, the tallest and<lb break="yes"/>most robust in the world.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>After remaining some months at <placeName key="barcelona">New<lb break="yes" />Barcelona</placeName> and Cumana, the travellers arrived<lb break="yes" />at the Havanna, after a tedious and danger-<lb break="no"/>ous navigation, the vessel being in the night<lb break="yes"/>on the point of striking upon the <placeName key="baxodelavibora">Vibora<lb break="yes"/>rocks</placeName>. Mr. H. remained three months in<lb break="yes"/>the island of Cuba, where he occupied him-<lb break="no"/>self in ascertaining the longitude of the Ha-<lb break="no"/>vanna, and in constructing stoves on the su-<lb break="no"/>gar plantations, which have since been pret-<lb break="no"/>ty generally adopted. They were on the<lb break="yes"/>point of setting off for Vera Cruz, meaning,<lb break="yes"/>by the way of Mexico and <placeName key="acapulco" >Acapulco</placeName>, to go<lb break="yes"/>to the Philippine Islands, and from thence,<lb break="yes"/>if it was possible, by Bombay and <placeName key="aleppo">Aleppo</placeName>,<lb break="yes"/>to Constantinople, when some false reports<lb break="yes"/>relative to <persName key="baudin_tn" >Baudin&#x2019;s</persName> voyage alarmed them,<lb break="yes"/>and made them change their plan. The<lb break="yes"/>gazettes held out the idea that this navigator<lb break="yes"/>would proceed from France to Buenos Ay-<lb break="no"/>res, and from thence, by Cape Horn, for<lb break="yes"/>Chili and the coast of Peru. Mr. <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName>
                    <lb break="yes"/>had promised to Mr. <persName key="baudin_tn">Baudin</persName> and to the<lb break="yes"/>Museum of Paris, that wherever he might be,<lb break="yes"/>he would endeavour to join the expedition,<lb break="yes"/>as soon as he should know of its having been<lb break="yes"/>commenced. He flattered himself that his<lb break="yes"/>researches, and those of his friend <persName key="bonpland_ajag">Bonpland</persName>,<lb break="yes"/>might be more useful to science, if united to<lb break="yes"/>the labours of the learned men who would<lb break="yes"/>accompany captain <persName key="baudin_tn" >Baudin</persName>.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>These considerations induced Mr. Hum-<lb break="no"/>boldt to send his manuscripts, for 1799 and<lb break="yes"/>1800, direct to Europe, and to freight a<lb break="yes"/>small schooner at <placeName key="batabano" >Batabano</placeName>, intending to go<lb break="yes"/>to Carthagena, and from thence, as quick-<lb break="no"/>ly as possible, by the Isthmus of Panama,<lb break="yes"/>to the South Sea. He hoped to find cap-<lb break="no"/>tain <persName key="baudin_tn">Baudin</persName> at Guayaquil, or at Lima, and<lb break="yes"/>with him to visit New Holland, and the is-<lb break="no"/>lands of the Pacific Ocean, equally interesting<lb break="yes" />in a moral point of view, as by the luxuri-<lb break="no"/>ance of their vegetation.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>It appeared imprudent to expose the<lb break="yes"/>manuscripts and collections already made<lb break="yes"/>to the risks of this proposed navigation.<lb break="yes"/>These manuscripts, of the fate of which Mr.<lb break="yes"/>H. remained ignorant during three years,<lb break="yes"/>and until his arrival in Philadelphia, arriv-<lb break="no"/>ed safe, but one third part of the collection<lb break="yes"/>was lost by shipwreck. Fortunately (ex-<lb break="no"/>cept the insects of the Oronoco and of the<lb break="yes"/>Rio Negro) they were only duplicates; but<lb break="yes"/>unhappily friar <persName key="gonzalez_j">John Gonzales</persName>, monk of<lb break="yes"/>the order of St. <persName key="franzvonassisi">Francis</persName>, the friend to whom<lb break="yes"/>they were entrusted, perished with them.<lb break="yes"/>He was a young man full of ardour, who<lb break="yes"/>had penetrated into this unknown world of<lb break="yes"/>Spanish Guayana further than any other<lb break="yes" />European.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Mr. <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName> left <placeName key="batabano">Batabano</placeName> in March,<lb break="yes"/>1801, and passed to the south of the island<lb break="yes"/>of Cuba, on which he determined many<lb break="yes"/>geographical positions. The passage was<lb break="yes"/>rendered very long by calms, and the cur-<lb break="no"/>rents carried the little schooner too much<lb break="yes"/>to the west, to the mouths of the <placeName key="atrato">Attracto</placeName>.<lb break="yes"/>The vessel put into the river Sinu, which no<lb break="yes"/>botanist had ever before visited, and they<lb break="yes"/>had a very difficult passage up to Cartha-<lb break="no"/>gena. The season being too far advanced<lb break="yes"/>for the South Sea navigation, the project of<lb break="yes"/>crossing the isthmus was abandoned; and<lb break="yes"/>animated by the desire of being acquainted<lb break="yes"/>with the celebrated <persName key="mutis_jc">Mutis</persName>, and admiring his<lb break="yes"/>immensely rich collections of objects of na-<lb break="no"/>tural history, Mr. H. determined to pass<lb break="yes"/>some weeks in the woods of Turbaco, and<lb break="yes"/>to ascend (which took forty days) the beau-<lb break="no"/>tiful river of Madelaine, of the course of<lb break="yes"/>which he sketched a chart.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>From Honda, our travellers ascended<lb break="yes"/>through forests of oaks, of <hi rendition="#i">melastoma,</hi> and of<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">cinchona</hi> (the tree which affords the Peruvian<lb break="yes"/>bark), to St. Fe de Bogota, capital of the<lb break="yes" />kingdom of New Grenada, situated in a<lb break="yes"/>fine plain, elevated 1360 toises (of six<lb break="yes"/>French feet) above the level of the sea.<lb break="yes"/>The superb collections of <persName key="mutis_jc" >Mutis</persName>, the majes-<lb break="no"/>tic cataract of the Tequedama (falls of 98<lb break="yes"/>toises height) the mines of Mariquita, St.<lb break="yes"/>Ana, and of Zipaquira, the natural bridge<lb break="yes"/>of Scononza (three stones thrown together<lb break="yes"/>in the manner of an arch, by an earthquake),<lb break="yes"/>these curious objects stopped the progress<lb break="yes"/>of Messrs. <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName> and <persName key="bonpland_ajag">Bonpland</persName> until<lb break="yes"/>the month of September, 1801.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>At this time, notwithstanding the rainy<lb break="yes"/>season had commenced, they undertook the<lb break="yes"/>journey to Quito, and passed the <placeName key="anden">Andes</placeName> of<lb break="yes"/>Quindiu, which are snowy mountains co-<lb break="no"/>vered with wax palm-trees (palmiers a cire),<lb break="yes"/>with passe flores (passion flowers) of the<lb break="yes" />growth of trees, storax, and bambusa (bam-<lb break="no"/>boo). They were, during 13 days, obliged<lb break="yes"/>to pass on foot through places dreadfully<lb break="yes"/>swampy, and without any traces of popu-<lb break="no"/>lation.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>From the village of Carthago, in the<lb break="yes"/>valley of Cauca, they followed the course of<lb break="yes"/>the Choco, the country of Platina, which<lb break="yes"/>was there found in round pieces of basalte<lb break="yes"/>and green rock (grein stein of <persName key="werner_ag" >Werner</persName>), and<lb break="yes"/>fossil wood. They pass by Buga to Po-<lb break="no"/>payan, a bishop&#x2019;s see, and situated near the<lb break="yes"/>volcanoes of <hi rendition="#i">Sotara and Purace,</hi> a most pic-<lb break="no"/>turesque situation, and enjoying the most<lb break="yes" />delicious climate in the world, the thermo-<lb break="no"/>meter of Reamur keeping constantly at 16<lb break="yes"/>to 18 (68 to 72 Fahr.) They ascended to<lb break="yes"/>the crater of the volcano of Purace, whose<lb break="yes" />mouth, in the middle of snow, throws out<lb break="yes"/>vapours of sulphurous hydrogene, with con-<lb break="no"/>tinued and frightful rumbling.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>From Popayan they passed by the danger-<lb break="no"/>ous defiles of <placeName key="almager">Almager</placeName>, avoiding the infect-<lb break="no"/>ed and contagious valley of Patia, to Posto,<lb break="yes"/>and from this town, even now situated at<lb break="yes"/>the foot of a burning volcano, by Tuqueras<lb break="yes"/>and the provinces of Pastos, a flat portion of<lb break="yes"/>country, fertile in European grain, but ele-<lb break="no" />vated more than 1500 to 1600 toises above<lb break="yes"/>the towns of Ibarra and Quito.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>They arrived, in January, 1802, at this<lb break="yes"/>beautiful capital, celebrated by the labours<lb break="yes"/>of the illustrious <persName key="lacondamine_cmd">Condamine</persName>, of <persName key="bouguer_p" >Bouger</persName>,<lb break="yes"/>
                    <persName key="godin_l">Godin</persName>, Don <persName key="juanysantacilia_j" >George Juan</persName>, and <persName key="ulloa_ad">Ulloa</persName>, and<lb break="yes"/>still more celebrated by the great amiability<lb break="yes"/>of its inhabitants, and their happy turn for<lb break="yes" />the arts.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>They remained nearly a year in the king-<lb break="no"/>dom of Quito: the height of its snow-cap-<lb break="no"/>ped mountains, its terrible earthquakes<lb break="yes"/>(that of February 7, 1797, swallowed up<lb break="yes"/>42,000 inhabitants, in a few seconds), its<lb break="yes"/>fertility, and the manners of its inhabitants,<lb break="yes"/>combined to render it the most interesting<lb break="yes"/>spot in the universe. After three vain at-<lb break="no"/>tempts, they twice succeeded in ascending<lb break="yes"/>to the crater of the volcano of Pichincha,<lb break="yes"/>taking with them electrometers, barometers,<lb break="yes"/>and hydrometers. <persName key="lacondamine_cmd">Condamine</persName> could only<lb break="yes"/>stop here a few minutes, <hi rendition="#i">and that without<lb break="yes" />instruments.</hi> In his time, this immense cra-<lb break="no"/>ter was cold and filled with snow. Our<lb break="yes"/>travellers found it inflamed; distressing in-<lb break="no"/>formation for the town of Quito, which is<lb break="yes"/>distant from it only 5000 to 6000 toises.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>They made separate visits to the snowy<lb break="yes"/>and porphyritic mountains of <placeName key="antisana">Antisana</placeName>, Co-<lb break="no"/>topaxi, Tungaraque, and Chimborazo, the<lb break="yes"/>last the highest point of our globe. They<lb break="yes"/>studied the geological part of the Cordillera<lb break="yes"/>of the <placeName key="anden">Andes</placeName>, on which subject nothing has<lb break="yes"/>been published in Europe, mineralogy (if<lb break="yes"/>the expression may be used) having been<lb break="yes" />created, as it were, since the time of <persName key="lacondamine_cmd">Con-<lb break="no"/>damine</persName>. The geodesical measurements<lb break="yes"/>proved that some mountains, particularly<lb break="yes"/>the volcano of Tungaraque, has considera-<lb break="no"/>bly lowered since 1750, which result agrees<lb break="yes"/>with the observations made to them by the<lb break="yes"/>inhabitants.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>During the whole of this part of the jour-<lb break="no"/>ney, they were accompanied by Mr. <persName key="montufarylarrea_c">Charles<lb break="yes" />Montutar</persName>, son of the <persName key="montufarylarrea_jpd" >marquis of Selva-ale-<lb break="no"/>gre</persName>, of Quito, a person zealous for the pro-<lb break="no"/>gress of science, and who is, at his own ex-<lb break="no"/>pence, rebuilding the pyramids of Saraqui,<lb break="yes" />the extremity of the celebrated bases of the<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">triangles</hi> of the Spanish and French academi-<lb break="no"/>cians. This interesting young man having<lb break="yes" />followed Mr. <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName> in the remainder of<lb break="yes"/>his journey through Peru and the kingdom<lb break="yes" />of New Spain, is now on his passage with<lb break="yes"/>him to Europe.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Circumstances were so favourable to the<lb break="yes"/>efforts of the three travellers, that at <placeName key="antisana">Anti-<lb break="no" />sana</placeName> they ascended 2200 French feet, and at<lb break="yes" />Chimborazo, on June 22, 1802, nearly 3200<lb break="yes"/>feet higher than <persName key="lacondamine_cmd">Condamine</persName> was able to car-<lb break="no"/>ry his instruments. They ascended to 3036<lb break="yes"/>toises elevation above the level of the sea, the<lb break="yes"/>blood starting from their eyes, lips, and<lb break="yes"/>gums. An opening, of 80 toises deep, and<lb break="yes"/>very wide, prevented them from reaching<lb break="yes" />the top, from which they were only distant<lb break="yes"/>134 toises.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>It was at Quito that Mr. <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName> re-<lb break="no"/>ceived a letter from the National Institute<lb break="yes"/>of France, informing him that captain <persName key="baudin_tn">Bau-<lb break="no" />din</persName> had proceeded by the Cape of Good<lb break="yes"/>Hope, and that there was no longer any<lb break="yes"/>hope of joining him.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>After having examined the country over-<lb break="no"/>turned by the earthquake of Riobamba, in<lb break="yes"/>1797, they passed by the <placeName key="anden" >Andes</placeName> of <placeName key="assuay">Assuay</placeName>
                    <lb break="yes"/>to Cuenza. The desire of comparing the<lb break="yes" />Cinchonas discovered by Mr. <persName key="mutis_jc">Mutis</persName>, at San-<lb break="no"/>ta Fe de Bogota, and with those of Popayan,<lb break="yes"/>and the cuspa and cuspare of New Andalu-<lb break="no"/>sia, and of the river Caroni (named falsely<lb break="yes"/>Cortex Angustura), with the Cinchonas of<lb break="yes"/>Loxa and Peru, they preferred deviating<lb break="yes"/>from the beaten track from Cuenza to Li-<lb break="no"/>ma; but they passed with immense dif-<lb break="no"/>ficulties in the carriage of their instruments<lb break="yes"/>and collections, by the forest (paramo) of<lb break="yes"/>Saragura to Loxa, and from thence to the<lb break="yes" />province of Saen de Bracamoros. They had<lb break="yes"/>to cross thirty-five times, two days, the river<lb break="yes"/>Guancabamba, so dangerous for its sudden<lb break="yes"/>freshes. They saw the ruins of the superb<lb break="yes"/>Ynga road comparable to the finest roads in<lb break="yes" />France, and which went upon the ridge of<lb break="yes"/>the <placeName key="anden">Andes</placeName> from Cusco to the <placeName key="assuay" >Assuay</placeName>, ac-<lb break="no"/>commodated with fountains and taverns.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>They descended the river Chamaya, which<lb break="yes"/>led them into that of the <placeName key="amazonas">Amazones</placeName>, and they<lb break="yes" />navigated this last river down to the cata-<lb break="no"/>racts of Tomeperda, one of the most fertile,<lb break="yes"/>but one of the hottest, climates of the habit-<lb break="no"/>able globe. From the <placeName key="amazonas">Amazone river</placeName> they<lb break="yes"/>returned to the south-east by the Cordillera<lb break="yes"/>of the <placeName key="anden">Andes</placeName> to Montar, where they found<lb break="yes"/>they had passed the <placeName key="magnetaequator">magnetic equator</placeName>, the<lb break="yes" />inclination being 0, although at seven de-<lb break="no"/>grees of south latitude. They visited the<lb break="yes"/>mines of Hualguayoc, where native silver is<lb break="yes"/>found at the height of 2000 toises. Some<lb break="yes"/>of the veins of these mines contain petrified<lb break="yes" />shells, and which, with those of Pasco and<lb break="yes"/>Huantajayo, are actually the richest of Pe-<lb break="no"/>ru. From Caxamarca they descended to<lb break="yes"/>Truxillo, in the neighbourhood of which are<lb break="yes"/>found the ruins of the immense Peruvian ci-<lb break="no"/>ty, Mansiche.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>It was on this western descent of the An-<lb break="no"/>des that the three voyagers, for the first time,<lb break="yes"/>had the pleasure of seeing the Pacific O-<lb break="no"/>cean. They followed its barren sides, for-<lb break="no"/>merly watered by the canals of the Yngas<lb break="yes"/>at Santa Guerma, and Lima. They re-<lb break="no"/>mained some months in this interesting capi-<lb break="no"/>tal of Peru, of which the inhabitants are dis-<lb break="no"/>tinguished by the vivacity of their genius,<lb break="yes"/>and the liberality of their ideas.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Mr. <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName> had the good fortune to<lb break="yes"/>observe the end of the passage of Mercury<lb break="yes"/>over the sun&#x2019;s disk, in the port of Callao.<lb break="yes"/>He was astonished to find, at such a dis-<lb break="no"/>tance from Europe, the most recent produc-<lb break="no"/>tions in chemistry, mathematics, and medi-<lb break="no"/>cine; and he found great activity of mind<lb break="yes"/>in the inhabitants, who, in a climate where<lb break="yes"/>it never either rains or thunders, have been<lb break="yes"/>falsely accused of indolence.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>From Lima our travellers passed by sea<lb break="yes"/>to Guayaquil, situated on the brink of a ri-<lb break="no"/>ver, where the growth of the palm tree is<lb break="yes"/>beautiful beyond description. They every<lb break="yes"/>moment heard the rumbling of the volcano<lb break="yes"/>of Cotopaxi, which made an alarming ex-<lb break="no"/>plosion on the 6th January, 1803. They<lb break="yes"/>immediately set off to visit it a second time,<lb break="yes" />when the unexpected intelligence of the<lb break="yes"/>speedy departure of the frigate Atalanta de-<lb break="no"/>termined them to return, after being seven<lb break="yes"/>days exposed to the dreadful attacks of the<lb break="yes"/>musquitoes of <placeName key="babaoyo">Babaoya</placeName> and Ujibar.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>They had a fortunate passage, by the Pa-<lb break="no"/>cific Ocean, to <placeName key="acapulco">Acapulco</placeName>, the western port<lb break="yes"/>of the kingdom of New Spain, famous for<lb break="yes"/>the beauty of its harbour, which appears to<lb break="yes"/>have been formed by earthquakes, for the<lb break="yes"/>misery of its inhabitants, and for its climate,<lb break="yes"/>which is equally hot and unhealthy.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Mr. <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName> had originally the intenti-<lb break="no"/>on to remain only a few months in Mexico,<lb break="yes"/>and to hasten his return to Europe; his voy-<lb break="no"/>age had already been too much protracted,<lb break="yes"/>his <choice><sic>intruments</sic><corr type="editorial">instruments</corr></choice>, particularly the chronome-<lb break="no"/>ters, began to be out of order, and every<lb break="yes"/>effort that he made to have new ones sent to<lb break="yes"/>him proved of no avail; add to this consi-<lb break="no" />deration, that the progress of science is so<lb break="yes"/>rapid in Europe, that, in a journey that<lb break="yes"/>lasts four or five years, great risk is run of<lb break="yes"/>contemplating the different phenomena un-<lb break="no" />der aspects, which are no longer interesting<lb break="yes"/>at the moment of publishing the result of<lb break="yes"/>your labours. Mr. <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName> hoped to be<lb break="yes"/>in France in August or September, 1803,<lb break="yes"/>but the attractions of a country, so beautiful<lb break="yes"/>and so varied, as is that of the kingdom of<lb break="yes"/>New Spain, the great hospitality of its in-<lb break="no" />habitants, and the fear of the yellow fever<note place="foot" n="*">
                        <hi rendition="#i">Vomito prieto.</hi>
                    </note>
                    <lb break="yes"/>so fatal, from June to November, for those<lb break="yes"/>who come from the mountainous part of the<lb break="yes"/>country, led him to stay a year in this king-<lb break="no"/>dom.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Our travellers ascended from <placeName key="acapulco">Acapulco</placeName>
                    <lb break="yes"/>to Tasco, celebrated for its mines, as inter-<lb break="no" />esting as they are ancient. They rise, by<lb break="yes"/>small degrees, from the ardent valley of<lb break="yes"/>Mescala and Papagayo, where the thermo-<lb break="no"/>meter of <persName key="reaumur_rafd">Reaumur</persName> stands, in the shade,<lb break="yes"/>constantly from 28 to 31 (95 to 101 Fah.),<lb break="yes"/>in a region 6 or 700 toises above the level<lb break="yes"/>of the sea, where you find the oaks, the<lb break="yes"/>pines, and the fougere (fern) as large as<lb break="yes"/>trees, and where the European grains are<lb break="yes"/>cultivated. They passed by Tasco, by<lb break="yes"/>Cuerna Vaca, to the capital of Mexico.&#x2014;<lb break="yes"/>This city of 150,000 inhabitants, is placed<lb break="yes"/>upon the ancient site of Texochtitlan, be-<lb break="no"/>tween the lakes of Tezcuco and Xochimil-<lb break="no" />co, lakes which have lessened somewhat<lb break="yes"/>since the Spaniards have opened the canal of<lb break="yes"/>Hucheutoca, in sight of two snow-topped<lb break="yes"/>mountains, of which one, Popocatepec, is<lb break="yes"/>even now an active volcano, surrounded by<lb break="yes"/>a great number of walks, shaded with trees,<lb break="yes"/>and by Indian villages.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>This capital of Mexico, situated 1160 toises<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">above the sea,</hi> in a mild and temperate climate,<lb break="yes"/>may doubtless be compared to some of the<lb break="yes"/>finest towns in Europe. Great scientific es-<lb break="no"/>tablishments, such as the Academy of Paint-<lb break="no"/>ing, Sculpture, and Engraving, the College<lb break="yes"/>of Mines, (owning to the liberality of the<lb break="yes" />Company of Miners of Mexico), and the<lb break="yes"/>Botanic Garden, are institutions which do<lb break="yes"/>honour to the government which has creat-<lb break="no"/>ed them.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>After remaining some months in the val-<lb break="no"/>ley of Mexico, and after fixing the longitude<lb break="yes"/>of the capital, which had been laid down<lb break="yes"/>with an error of nearly two degrees, our<lb break="yes" />travellers visited the mines of Moran and<lb break="yes"/>Real del Monte, and the Cerro of Oyamel,<lb break="yes"/>where the ancient Mexicans had the manu-<lb break="no"/>factory of knives made of the obsidian stone.<lb break="yes" />They soon after passed by Queretaro and<lb break="yes"/>Salamanca to Guanaxoato, a town of fifty<lb break="yes"/>thousand inhabitants, and celebrated for its<lb break="yes"/>mines, more rich than those of Potosi have<lb break="yes"/>ever been. The mine of the count of Va-<lb break="no" />lenciana, which is 1840 French feet perpen-<lb break="no"/>dicular depth, is the deepest and richest mine<lb break="yes"/>of the universe. This mine alone gives to<lb break="yes"/>its proprietor nearly six hundred thousand<lb break="yes"/>dollars annual and constant profit.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>From Guanaxoato they returned by the<lb break="yes"/>valley of St. Jago to Valladolid, in the an-<lb break="no"/>cient kingdom of Michuacan, one of the most<lb break="yes"/>fertile and charming provinces of the king-<lb break="no"/>dom. They descended from Pascuaro to-<lb break="no"/>wards the coast of the Pacific Ocean to the<lb break="yes"/>plains of Serullo, where, in 1759, in one<lb break="yes"/>night, a volcano arose from the level, sur-<lb break="no"/>rounded by two thousand small mouths,<lb break="yes"/>from whence smoke still continues to issue.<lb break="yes"/>They arrived almost to the bottom of the<lb break="yes"/>crater of the great volcano of Serullo, of<lb break="yes"/>which they analized the air, and found it<lb break="yes" />strongly impregnated with carbonic acid.&#x2014;<lb break="yes"/>They returned to Mexico by the valley of<lb break="yes"/>Toluca, and visited the volcano, to the high-<lb break="no"/>est point of which they ascended, 14,400<lb break="yes" />French feet above the level of the sea.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>In the months of January and February,<lb break="yes"/>1804, they pursued their researches on the<lb break="yes"/>eastern descent of the Cordilleras, they mea-<lb break="no"/>sured the mountains Novados de la Puebla,<lb break="yes" />Popocatyce, Izazihuatle, the great peak of<lb break="yes"/>Orizaba, and the Cofre de Perote; upon the<lb break="yes"/>top of this last Mr. <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName> observed the<lb break="yes"/>meredian height of the sun. In fine, after<lb break="yes"/>some residence at Xalappa, they embarked<lb break="yes"/>at Vera Crux, for the Havannah. They re-<lb break="no"/>sumed the collections they had left there in<lb break="yes" />1801, and by the way of Philadelphia, em-<lb break="no"/>barked for France, in July, 1804, after six<lb break="yes"/>years of absence and labours. A collection<lb break="yes"/>of 6000 different species of plants (of which<lb break="yes"/>a great part are new) and numerous miner-<lb break="no" />alogical, astronomical, chemical, and moral<lb break="yes"/>observations, have been the result of this ex-<lb break="no"/>pedition. Mr. <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName> gives the highest<lb break="yes" />praises to the liberal protection granted to his<lb break="yes"/>researches by the Spanish government.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Baron <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName> was born in Prussia, on<lb break="yes"/>the 14th of September, 1769.</p>
