    <p>Baron de Humboldt has addressed the following note to the Berlin<lb/>
        journals:&#x2014;&#x201C;Overwhelmed by the number of letters sent me, which<lb/>
        are increasing every day, amounting to from 1,600 to 2,000 per<lb/>
        annum, many, too, being on the most futile subjects, such as demands<lb/>
        for my autograph, and offers to cure me of all diseases, I once more<lb/>
        make a public appeal to the persons who wish me well, and request<lb/>
        them not to occupy themselves so much with what concerns me, in<lb/>
        order that with the diminution of strength, physical and intellectual,<lb/>
        which I experience, I may be allowed a little leisure for study and<lb/>
        composition. I trust that this step, to which I have recourse with<lb/>
        reluctance, will not be interpreted unkindly.&#x201D;</p><lb/></body><back></back>
