<div n="1"><head><hi rendition="#k">A Cheaper Light than Gas.</hi></head><p>&#x2014;On the road leading to<lb/>the port we were forcibly struck by a spectacle which our
                    stay<lb/>of two years in the hottest part of the tropics might have<lb/>rendered
                    familiar to us, but, previously, I had nowhere seen<lb/>such an innumerable
                    quantity of phosphorescent insects. The<lb/>grass that overspreads the ground,
                    the branches and foliage of<lb/>the trees, all shone with that reddish and
                    moveable light, which<lb/>varies in its intensity at the will of the animal by
                    which it is<lb/>produced. It seemed as though the starry firmament
                    reposed<lb/>on the Savannah. In the hut of the poorest inhabitant of
                    the<lb/>country, fifteen cocuyos, placed in a calabash pierced with<lb/>holes,
                    afford sufficient light to search for anything during the<lb/>night. To shake
                    the calabash forcibly is all that is necessary<lb/>to excite the animal to
                    increase the intensity of the luminous<lb/>discs situated on each side of its
                    body. The people of the<lb/>country remark, with a simple truth of expression,
                    that cala-<lb/>bashes filled with cocuyos are lanterns always ready
                    lighted.<lb/>They are, in fact, only extinguished by the sickness or
                    death<lb/>of the insects, which are easily fed with a little sugar-cane.
                    A<lb/>young woman at Trinidad de Cuba told us that during a long<lb/><cb/> and
                    difficult passage from the main land she always made use<lb/>of the
                    phosphoresence of the cocuyos when she gave suck to<lb/>her child at night; the
                    captain of the ship would allow no other<lb/>light on board, from the fear of
                        corsairs.&#x2014;<hi rendition="#i">Humboldt&#x2019;s Travels,<lb/>Vol.
