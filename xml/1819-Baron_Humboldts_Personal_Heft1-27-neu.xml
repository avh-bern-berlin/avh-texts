                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>A great drought prevailed in the province of Venezuela.<lb break="yes"/>Not a single drop of rain had fallen at Caraccas, or in the<lb break="yes"/>country ninety leagues round, during the five months which<lb break="yes"/>preceded the destruction of the capital. The 26th of March<lb break="yes"/>was a remarkably hot day. The air was calm and the sky<lb break="yes"/>unclouded. It was Holy Thursday, and a great part of the<lb break="yes"/>population was assembled in the churches. Nothing seemed<lb break="yes"/>to presage the calamities of the day. At seven minutes after<lb break="yes"/>four in the afternoon the first shock was felt; it was suffi-<lb break="no"/>ciently powerful to make the bells of the churches toll; it<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="231" facs="#f0002"/>lasted five or six seconds, during which time the ground was<lb break="yes"/>in a continual undulating movement, and seemed to heave up<lb break="yes"/>like a boiling liquid. The danger was thought to be past,<lb break="yes"/>when a tremendous subterraneous noise was heard, resembling<lb break="yes"/>the rolling of thunder, but louder, and of longer continuance,<lb break="yes"/>than that heard within the tropics in time of storms. The<lb break="yes"/>noise preceded a perpendicular motion of three or four se-<lb break="no"/>conds, followed by an undulatory movement somewhat longer.<lb break="yes"/>The shocks were in opposite directions, from north to south,<lb break="yes"/>and from east to west. Nothing could resist the movement<lb break="yes"/>from beneath upward, and the undulations crossing each other.<lb break="yes"/>The town of Caraccas was entirely overthrown. Thousands<lb break="yes"/>of the inhabitants (between nine and ten thousand) were buried<lb break="yes"/>under the ruins of the houses and churches. The procession<lb break="yes"/>had not yet set out; but the crowd was so great in the<lb break="yes"/>churches, that nearly three or four thousand persons were<lb break="yes"/>crushed by the fall of their fretted roofs. The explosion was<lb break="yes"/>stronger toward the north, in that part of the town situated<lb break="yes"/>nearest the mountain of Avila, and the Silla. The churches<lb break="yes"/>of La Trinidad, and Alta Gracia, which were more than one<lb break="yes"/>hundred and fifty feet high, and the naves of which were sup-<lb break="no"/>ported by pillars of twelve or fifteen feet diameter, left a mass<lb break="yes"/>of ruins scarcely exceeding five or six feet in elevation. The<lb break="yes"/>sinking of the ruins has been so considerable, that there now<lb break="yes"/>scarcely remain any vestiges of pillars or columns. The barracks,<lb break="yes"/>called <hi rendition="#g">El Quartel de San Carlos,</hi> situate farther north of<lb break="yes"/>the church of the Trinity, on the road from the eustomhouse de la<lb break="yes"/>Pastora, almost entirely disappeared. A regiment of troops<lb break="yes"/>of the line, that was assembled under arms, ready to join<lb break="yes"/>the procession, was, with the exception of a few men, buried<lb break="yes"/>under the ruins of this great edifice. Nine tenths of the fine<lb break="yes"/>town of Caraccas were entirely destroyed. The walls of the<lb break="yes"/>houses that were not thrown down, as those of the street<lb break="yes"/>San Juan, near the Capuchin Hospital, were cracked in such<lb break="yes"/>a manner that it was impossible to run the risk of inhabiting<lb break="yes"/>them. The effects of the earthquake were somewhat less vio-<lb break="no"/>lent in the western and southern parts of the city, between<lb break="yes"/>the principal square and the ravin of Caraguata. There the<lb break="yes"/>cathedral, supported by enormous buttresses, remains standing.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Estimating at nine or ten thousand the number of the<lb break="yes"/>dead in the city of Caraccas, we do not include those un-<lb break="no"/>happy persons, who, dangerously wounded, perished several<lb break="yes"/>months after for want of food and proper care. The night<lb break="yes"/>of Holy Thursday presented the most distressing scene of de-<lb break="no"/>solation and sorrow. That thick cloud of dust, which, rising<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="232" facs="#f0003"/> above the ruins, darkened the sky like a fog, had settled on<lb break="yes"/>the ground. No shock was felt, and never was a night more<lb break="yes"/>calm or more serene. The moon, nearly full, illumined the<lb break="yes"/>rounded domes of the <choice>
                        <sic>Villa</sic>
                        <corr type="editorial">Silla</corr>
                    </choice>, and the aspect of the sky formed<lb break="yes"/>a perfect contrast to that of the earth, covered with the dead<lb break="yes"/>and heaped with ruins. Mothers were seen bearing in their arms<lb break="yes"/>their children, whom they hoped to recall to life. Desolate families<lb break="yes"/>wandered through the city seeking a brother, a husband, a<lb break="yes"/>friend, of whose fate they were ignorant, and whom they<lb break="yes"/>believed to be lost in the crowd. The people pressed along<lb break="yes"/>the streets, which could no more be recognised but by long<lb break="yes"/>lines of ruins.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>All the calamities experienced in the great catastrophes<lb break="yes"/>of Lisbon, Messina, Lima and Riobamba, were renewed on<lb break="yes"/>the fatal day of the 26th of March 1812. The wounded,<lb break="yes"/>buried under the ruins, implored by their cries the help of<lb break="yes"/>the passers-by, and nearly two thousand were dug out. Never<lb break="yes"/>was pity displayed in a more affecting manner; never had<lb break="yes"/>it been seen more ingeniously active, than in the efforts em-<lb break="no"/>ployed to save the miserable victims, whose groans reached<lb break="yes"/>the ear. Implements for digging and clearing away the ruins<lb break="yes"/>were entirely wanting; and the people were obliged to use<lb break="yes"/>their bare hands to disinter the living. The wounded, as well<lb break="yes"/>as the sick who had escaped from the hospitals, were laid<lb break="yes"/>on the banks of the small river Guayra. They found no<lb break="yes"/>shelter but the foliage of trees. Beds, linen to dress the<lb break="yes"/>wounds, instruments of surgery, medicines, and objects of<lb break="yes"/>the most urgent necessity, were buried under the ruins. Every<lb break="yes"/>thing, even food, was wanting during the first days. Water<lb break="yes"/>became alike scarce in the interior of the city. The com-<lb break="no"/>motion had rent the pipes of the fountains; the falling-in of<lb break="yes"/>the earth had choaked up the springs that supplied them;<lb break="yes"/>and it became necessary, in order to have water, to go down<lb break="yes"/>to the river Guayra, which was considerably swelled; and<lb break="yes"/>then vessels to convey the water were wanting.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>There remained a duty to be fulfilled toward the dead,<lb break="yes"/>enjoined at once by piety and the dread of infection. It being<lb break="yes"/>impossible to inter so many thousand corpses, half-buried<lb break="yes"/>under the ruins, commissaries were appointed to burn the<lb break="yes"/>bodies; and for this purpose funeral piles were erected be-<lb break="no"/>tween the heaps of ruins. This ceremony lasted several days.<lb break="yes"/>Amid so many public calamities, the people devoted themselves<lb break="yes"/>to those religious duties, which they thought were the most<lb break="yes"/>fitted to appease the wrath of Heaven. Some, assembling in<lb break="yes"/>processions, sang funeral hymus; others, in a state of dis-<lb break="no"/>
                    <pb n="233" facs="#f0004"/>traction, confessed themselves aloud in the streets. In this<lb break="yes"/>town was now repeated what had been remarked in the<lb break="yes"/>province of Quito after the tremendous earthquake of 1797;<lb break="yes"/>&#x2014; a number of marriages were contracted, between persons<lb break="yes"/>who had neglected for many years to sanction their union<lb break="yes"/>by the sacerdotal benediction; children found parents, by whom<lb break="yes"/>they had never till then been acknowledged; restitutions were<lb break="yes"/>promised by persons who had never been accused of fraud;<lb break="yes"/>and families, who had long been enemies, were drawn to-<lb break="no"/>gether by the tie of common calamity.</p>
