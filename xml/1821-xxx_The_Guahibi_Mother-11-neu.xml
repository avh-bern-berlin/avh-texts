                        break="no"/>ful feelings. If, in these solitary scenes, man scarcely<lb

                        break="yes"/>humiliating for an European to see perpetuated by the<lb

                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>In 1797, the Missionary of San Fernando had led his<lb break="yes"/>Indians to
                    the banks of the Rio Guaviare, on one of those<lb break="yes"/>hostile
                    incursions which are prohibited alike by religion<lb break="yes"/>and the
                    Spanish laws. They found in an Indian hut, a<lb break="yes"

                        >Guahiba</corr></choice> mother with three children, two of whom were<lb
                        break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="191" facs="#f0002"/> still infants. They were occupied in preparing the
                    flour of<lb break="yes"/>cassava. Resistance was impossible; the father was
                        gone<lb break="yes"/>to fish, and the mother tried in vain to flee with her
                        chil-<lb break="no"/>dren. Scarcely had she reached the Savannah, when
                        she<lb break="yes"/>was seized by the Indians of the mission, who go to <hi
                        rendition="#i">hunt<lb break="yes"/>men</hi>, like the Whites and the
                    Negroes in Africa. The<lb break="yes"/>mother and her children were bound and
                    dragged to the<lb break="yes"/>bank of the river. The monk, seated in his boat,
                        waited<lb break="yes"/>the issue of an expedition of which he partook not
                    the dan-<lb break="no"/>ger. Had the mother made too violent a resistance,
                        the<lb break="yes"/>Indians would have killed her, for every thing is
                        permitted<lb break="yes"/>when they go to the conquest of souls, (á là
                    conquista espi-<lb break="no"/>ritual,) and it is children in particular they
                    seek to capture,<lb break="yes"/>in order to treat them in the mission as <hi
                        rendition="#i">poitos</hi>, or slaves of<lb break="yes"/>the Christians. The
                    prisoners were carried to San Fer-<lb break="no"/>nando in the hope that the
                    mother would be unable to find<lb break="yes"/>her way back to her home by land.
                    Far from those chil-<lb break="no"/>dren who had accompanied their father on the
                    day in which<lb break="yes"/>she had been carried off, this unhappy woman showed
                        signs<lb break="yes"/>of the deepest despair. She attempted to take back to
                        her<lb break="yes"/>family the children who had been snatched away by the<lb
                        break="yes"/>Missionary; and fled with them repeatedly from the village<lb
                        break="yes"/>of San Fernando, but the Indians never failed to seize her<lb
                        break="yes"/>anew; and the Missionary, after having caused her to be<lb
                        break="yes"/>mercilessly beaten, took the cruel resolution of separating<lb
                        break="yes"/>the mother from the two children who had been carried off<lb
                        break="yes"/>with her. She was conveyed alone toward the Missions of<lb
                        break="yes"/>the Rio Negro, going up the Atabapo. Slightly bound, she<lb
                        break="yes"/>was seated at the bow of the boat, ignorant of the fate that<lb
                        break="yes"/>awaited her; but she judged by the direction of the sun,<lb
                        break="yes"/>that she was removing farther from her hut and her native<lb
                        break="yes"/>country. She succeeded in breaking her bonds, threw her-<lb
                        break="no"/>self into the water, and swam to the left bank of the Ata-<lb
                        break="no"/>bapo. The current carried her to a shelf of rock, which<lb
                        break="yes"/>bears her name to this day, she landed and took shelter in<lb
                        break="yes"/>the woods, but the president of the Missions ordered the<lb
                        break="yes"/>Indians to row to the shore, and follow the traces of the<lb

                        >Guahiba</corr></choice>. In the evening she was brought back. Stretched<lb
                        break="yes"/>upon the rock (la Piedra de la Madre) a cruel punishment<lb
                        break="yes"/>was <choice><sic>inflcted</sic><corr type="editorial"
                            >inflicted</corr></choice> on her with those straps of Manatee
                        leather,<lb break="yes"/>which serve for whips in that country, and with
                    which the<lb break="yes"/>Alcades are always furnished. This unhappy woman,
                        her<lb break="yes"/>hands tied behind her back with strong stalks of
                        mava-<lb break="no"/>cure, was then dragged to the Mission of Javita. She
                        was<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="192" facs="#f0003"/> then thrown into one of the caravanseras that are
                        called<lb break="yes"/>Casa del Rey. It was the rainy season, and the night
                        was<lb break="yes"/>profoundly dark. Forests, till then believed to be
                        impene-<lb break="no"/>trable, separated the Mission of Javita from that of
                        San<lb break="yes"/>Fernando, which was 25 leagues distant, in a straight
                        line.<lb break="yes"/>No other path is known than that of the rivers; no
                        man<lb break="yes"/>ever attempted to go by land from one village to
                        another,<lb break="yes"/>were they only a few leagues apart. But such
                        difficulties<lb break="yes"/>do not stop a mother who is separated from her
                        children.<lb break="yes"/>Her children are at San Fernando de Atabapo; she
                        must<lb break="yes"/>find them again; she must execute her project of
                        delivering<lb break="yes"/>them from the hands of Christians; of bringing
                    them back<lb break="yes"/>to their father on the banks of the Guaviare. The
                            <choice><sic>Guahita</sic><corr type="editorial"
                        >Guahiba</corr></choice><lb break="yes"/>was carelessly guarded in the
                    caravansera. Her arms being<lb break="yes"/>wounded, the Indians of Javita had
                    loosened her bonds, un-<lb break="no"/>known to the Missionary and the Alcades.
                    She succeeded,<lb break="yes"/>by the help of her teeth, in breaking them
                    entirely; disap-<lb break="no"/>peared during the night; and at the fourth
                    rising sun was<lb break="yes"/>seen at the mission of San Fernando, hovering
                    around the<lb break="yes"/>hut where her children were confined.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>&#x201C;What that woman performed,&#x201D; added the Missionary<lb break="yes"
                    />who gave us this sad narrative, &#x201C;the most robust Indian<lb break="yes"
                    />would not have ventured to undertake. She traversed the<lb break="yes"/>woods
                    at a season when the sky is constantly covered with<lb break="yes"/>clouds, and
                    the sun during whole days appears but for a<lb break="yes"/>few minutes. Did the
                    course of the waters direct her way?<lb break="yes"/>The inundations of the
                    rivers forced her to go far from the<lb break="yes"/>banks of the main stream,
                    through the midst of woods<lb break="yes"/>where the movement of the waters is
                    scarcely perceptible.<lb break="yes"/>How often must she have been stopped by
                    the thorny<lb break="yes"/>lianas, that form a net-work around the trunks they
                        entwine!<lb break="yes"/>How often must she have swum across the rivulets
                    that run<lb break="yes"/>into the Atabapo! This unfortunate woman was asked,<lb
                        break="yes"/>how she had sustained herself during four days: she said,<lb
                        break="yes"/>that, exhausted with fatigue, she could find no other
                        nourish-<lb break="no"/>ment than those great black ants, called <hi
                        rendition="#i">vachacos,</hi> which<lb break="yes"/>climb the trees in long
                    bands, to suspend on them their<lb break="yes"/>resinous nests.&#x201D; We
                    pressed the Missionary to tell us,<lb break="yes"/>whether the
                            <choice><sic>Guahita</sic><corr type="editorial">Guahiba</corr></choice>
                    had peacefully enjoyed the happiness<lb break="yes"/>of remaining with her
                    children; and if any repentance had<lb break="yes"/>followed this excess of
                    cruelty? He would not satisfy our<lb break="yes"/>curiosity: but at our return
                    from the Rio Negro, we learnt<lb break="yes"/>that the Indian mother was not
                    allowed time to cure her<lb break="yes"/>wounds, but was again separated from
                    her children, and<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="193" facs="#f0004"/> sent to one of the Missions of the Upper Oroonoko.
                        There<lb break="yes"/>she died, refusing all kind of nourishment, as the
                        savages<lb break="yes"/>do in great calamities.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Such is the remembrance annexed to this fatal rock, to<lb break="yes"/>the Piedra
                    de la Madre. If I have dwelt longer on the<lb break="yes"/>rock of the
                            <choice><sic>Guahita</sic><corr type="editorial"
                    >Guahiba</corr></choice>, it was to display an affecting instance<lb break="yes"
                    />of maternal tenderness in a race of people so long calum-<lb break="no"
                    />niated; and because I thought some benefit might accrue<lb break="yes"/>from
                    publishing a fact, which I had from the Monks of St.<lb break="yes"/>Francis,
                    and which proves how much the system of the<lb break="yes"/>Missions calls for
                    the care of the legislator.</p>
