    <p><hi rendition="#i">To the Editor of The Boston Journal:</hi></p>
<p>Within a few days, letters have been received in Ber-<lb/>lin from Montevideo, bringing painful
          rumor<lb/>that Amie Bonpland, the celebrated botanist, the<lb/>beloved friend and
          fellow-traveller of Alexander V.<lb/>Humboldt, is no more. Should this rumor be
          con-<lb/>firmed, and there is little occasion to question its<lb/>truth, Bonpland will
          have passed away, after an event-<lb/>ful life of unremitted toil and research in the
          realm<lb/>of natural science, at the ripe age of eighty-five; he<lb/>was still engaged, up
          to a short period previous to the<lb/>time of his reported death, in arduous agricultural
          and<lb/>botanical pursuits. The sorrow which this rumor has<lb/>diffused throughout
          Europe, is but the natural regret<lb/>which all men feel when a noble spirit departs
          from<lb/>among them, and bears no resemblance to the grief<lb/>awakened when a man of
          promise is cut down in the<lb/>fullness of strength and expectation, to disappoint
          the<lb/>hopes of the world. He had done work enough for<lb/>one lifetime, and leaving
          mankind a noble legacy of<lb/>scientific results, has passed away to higher spheres
          of<lb/>labor. &#x201C;Well done!&#x201D; is the signet stamp upon the<lb/>record of his
          days.</p>
                <p>I have obtained from a gentleman of this city, who<lb/>has access to private
          sources of information, and espe-<lb/>cially to the correspondence between Humboldt
          and<lb/>Bonpland, an interesting sketch of the life of the<lb/>great botanist. To insert
          the whole of it here would<lb/>swell my letter far beyond the prescribed limits, and
          I<lb/>must content myself with such brief references to cer-<lb/>tain portions of his
          eventful history as will serve to il-<lb/>lustrate the touching letter which Humboldt
          dedicates<lb/>to the memory of his lifelong friend.</p>
                 
                <p>The intimacy of these two illustrious men began dur-<lb/>ing Humboldt&#x2019;s
          visit to Paris in May, 1798, shortly<lb/>after Napoleon had sailed from Toulon upon his
          dis-<lb/>astrous expedition to Egypt. Bonpland was about<lb/>four years his junior, finely
          cultivated in his profes-<lb/>sion, ardent in temperament, and in him the
          maturer<lb/>German found a man after his own heart. The grand<lb/>result of this fortunate
          acquaintance, was the journey<lb/>they performed together, during the years
          1799&#x2014;1804,<lb/>through the American tropics, a journey which has<lb/>furnished
          material, besides the more immediate scien-<lb/>tific results, for some of the most
          magnificent descrip-<lb/>tive passages of the Cosmos. Humboldt&#x2019;s letters
          bear<lb/>frequent witness to the disinterested affection and de-<lb/>votion of his fellow
          traveller, who in more than one<lb/>dangerous adventure displayed that greatest of
          all<lb/>love, which is willing to sacrifice life itself for its<lb/>friend. In health and
          sickness, in every privation, in<lb/>every pleasure incident to their long wanderings,
          the<lb/>two friends were inseparable, and the lonely forests<lb/>of the Amazon and the
          Orinoco, the intimacy which<lb/>began in the gay capital of France ripened into
          a<lb/>friendship, which after half a century receives its first<lb/>interruption by the
          death of Bonpland.</p>
                 
                <p>On his return to Europe, Bonpland was introduced<lb/>to Josephine, and by her
          favor obtained the office of<lb/>Superintendent of the royal gardens at Malmaison
          and<lb/>Navarre. Here, in the sunshine of imperial favor, he<lb/>passed the happiest and
          palmiest days of his life. But<lb/>it was in darker days, when the divorced
          Empress<lb/>could no longer distribute royal patronage, that the<lb/>true nobleness of his
          character appeared. He remain-<lb/>ed the faithful friend of his fallen benefactress, and
          to<lb/>him she confided her most secret sorrows.</p>
                 
                <p>After Josephine&#x2019;s death, Bonpland, finding no place<lb/>of repose in
          Europe, emigrated in 1816 to Buenos<lb/>Ayres, taking with him a large number of fruit
          trees<lb/>and a variety of other natural productions. He was<lb/>there received with due
          honor, and soon afterward<lb/>received the appointment of Professor of Natural
          His-<lb/>tory. His restless temperament soon incited him to<lb/>undertake a journey
          through the interior of the con-<lb/>tinent, a journey fraught with unhappy
          consequences<lb/>to himself and to science. For in passing through a<lb/>portion of
          territory claimed by the Argentine Confed-<lb/>eracy, he unfortunately incurred the
          jealousy of the<lb/>Dictator, Dr. Francia, by whom he was seized in the<lb/>most dastardly
          manner and thrown in confinement.<lb/>True greatness always rises above misfortune,
          and<lb/>Bonpland, denied a hearing by his persecutor, confined<lb/>to a small plantation,
          dressed in the clothing of a<lb/>slave, and compelled to perform menial labor for
          his<lb/>daily bread, nobly resigned himself to his destiny, and<lb/>endeavored to make the
          best of it. He was always<lb/>ready to give assistence to the sick, and by<lb/> his gentle
          benevolence won the hearts of all<lb/>who knew him. Nor was his scientific
          ardor<lb/>suffered meanwhile to lie dormant. He made<lb/>large additions to his collection
          of plants, and occu-<lb/>pied himself a portion of the time in the distillation<lb/>of
          brandy from honey. Notwithstanding the inter-<lb/>cession of Alexander V. Humboldt and the
          remon-<lb/>strances of France and England, he remained a cap-<lb/>tive for nearly ten
          years. In 1831 he was released<lb/>without the formality of a trial, and sent away
          from<lb/>the country which had so long been his prison.</p>
                 
                <p>Refusing the most pressing invitations to return to<lb/>Europe, Bonpland lived
          until recently upon his estate<lb/>in the village of San Borgia. Conforming in
          almost<lb/>every thing, except his ardor in the scientific pursuits, to<lb/>the habits
          of the natives, he married an Indian wo-<lb/>man, and in the midst of the most enchanting
          region<lb/>in the new world built himself a quiet and happy<lb/>home. Here, surrounded
          by an affectionate family,<lb/>revered by every one, and at perfect liberty, he
          con-<lb/>ceived and carried into execution many schemes for<lb/>the advancement of
          agriculture, besides adding con-<lb/>tinually to his immense collection of plants.</p>
                 
                <p>But neither the charms of a simple life, nor the en-<lb/>grossing nature of his
          pursuits, could wholly wean<lb/>his heart from the old associations. Though
          firmly<lb/>resolved to live and die upon his own estate in the<lb/>new world, he long
          cherished the hope of a flying visit<lb/>to the old. He desired, with all the ardor of a
            life-<lb break="hyph-yes"/>long friendship, to see Humboldt once more, that he<lb/>might
          talk over &#x201C;old times&#x201D; with him. How deeply<lb/>this feeling was shared by
          his illustrious friend, I need<lb/>not say. For many years they have maintained a
          con-<lb/>stant correspondence, and though separated thousands<lb/>of miles, each has felt
          a certain society in the life of<lb/>the other. The senior by about four years,
          Humboldt<lb/>fondly hoped that he might not survive the last, the<lb/>most faithful, the
          noblest and best beloved of all the<lb/>friends of his long life. Yet so it must be. It is
          the<lb/>destiny of this venerable man to follow all his friends<lb/>to the grave, and to
          remain himself the sole represen-<lb/>tative of the times of his youth. One after
          another,<lb/>within a few years, the great men who started with<lb/>him and kept pace with
          him, have gone to their rest<lb/>and their final fame, and now Bonpland has left
          him.<lb/>How deeply he feels this fresh bereavement, the fol-<lb/>lowing letter affords
          touching evidence. It was written<lb/>for publication in the German papers, but I
          have<lb/>learned, from a private source, that the venerable man<lb/>desires its
          circulation in the journals of the United<lb/>States, as a mark of respect and esteem both
          for Bon-<lb/>pland and his &#x201C;American friends&#x201D;:</p> <div n="2">
                    <head><hi rendition="#k">humboldt&#x2019;s letter.</hi></head>
                    <p>Conscious of the deep sympathy of numerous<lb/>friends in the sorrow
            occasioned by the wide-spread<lb/>report of the death of my dear, noble friend and
            fel-<lb/>low-traveler, Bonpland, I consider it my duty to give<lb/>at least a brief
            notice of this event, for the particulars<lb/>of which I am indebted to the kind
            services of Dr.<lb/>Lallemant, author of an important paper on the dis-<lb/>eases of
            Europeans in the tropics. This talented gen-<lb/>tleman, after leaving the Austrian
            royal expedition in<lb/>the frigate Novara, in February of this year, for
            the<lb/>purpose of doing a kindness to myself, made the<lb/>journey from Rio Janeiro to
            Rio Grande, and thence<lb/>by way of Porto Alegro through the former Jesuit<lb/>Mission
            to San Borgia, under the erroneous impres-<lb/>sion that Bonpland, who had gone there in
            1831, was<lb/>still resident at that place. I have received two letters<lb/>from Dr.
            Lallemant, one dated at San Borgia on the<lb/>10th of April, the other written from the
            village of<lb/>Umguaiana, after he had visited Bonpland at Santa<lb/>Anna. An extended
            abstract of these letters having<lb/>been sent to the editor of the widely-read and
            interest-<lb/>ing botanical jonrnal, the <hi rendition="#i">Bonplandia,</hi> in Hanover,
            the<lb/>following briefer extracts may here suffice.</p>
                    <p>&#x201C;In San Borgia,&#x201D; writes Dr. Lallemant, I lived with<lb/>an
            intimate friend of Bonpland, the Vicar Gray, with<lb/>whom I visited the garden of the
            botanist, so long<lb/>cultivated with care, but now lying waste and deso-<lb/>late. It
            was near the close of the year 1857 that the<lb/>Vicar last received letters from
            Bonpland, since when<lb/>intelligence had come of his severe illness. Letters
            of<lb/>inquiry still remained unanswered, and notwithstand-<lb/>ing the short distance
            between the places, the people<lb/>of San Borgia were uncertain whether I should
            find<lb/>you fellow travellers yet in the land of the living. In<lb/>1853 Bonpland had
            left San Borgia and taken up his<lb/>residence upon his larger plantation of Santa
            Anna,<lb/>where he had long occupied himself in the cultivation<lb/>of orange trees. The
            residence of the aged scholar in<lb/>the Estancia of Santa Anna, consists of two
            large<lb/>buildings, mere clay walls, bound together by bamboo<lb/>sticks and a few
            beams, and thatched with straw.<lb/>These buildings have doors, but no windows, the
            light<lb/>being admitted through the chinks between the bam-<lb/>boo sticks. Despite the
            deep furrows which an event-<lb/>ful life had engraven in the beloved countenance,
            his<lb/>eye had not grown dim nor lost any of its full-thought-<lb/>ed vivacity. But
            lively conversation, though started<lb/>by himself, appeared to weary him much, and he
            suf-<lb/>fered severely from a chronic affection of the bladder.<lb/>The privations he
            had so strangely imposed upon him-<lb/>self are by no means in consequence of poverty,
            or of<lb/>any necessity for abstinence, but of long custom, great<lb/>self-control, and
            characteristic individuality. The gov-<lb/>ernment of Corrientes has presented to him an
            estate<lb/>valued at 10,000 Spanish piasters, and he enjoys a<lb/>French pension of
            3,000 francs a year. He has never<lb/>made the practice of medicine a source of
            pecuniary<lb/>profit to himself. Though universally revered, he<lb/>loves the solitude,
            and especially avoids all persons<lb/>who might offer him assistance or advice. His
            scien-<lb/>tific ardor has not yet abated, and his collections and<lb/>manuscripts are
            deposited in Corrientes, where he has<lb/>founded a national Museum.</p>
                    <p>On the following morning I found him visibly<lb/>worse, and sinking away.
            The night had been a pain-<lb/>ful one. I pressed him to tell me whether I might
            not,<lb/>in some way, be of service to him. But I fared no bet-<lb/>ter than his other
            friends&#x2014;he would accept of no as-<lb/>sistence. How gladly would I have persuaded
            him to<lb/>return once more to civilized society! But I, too, felt<lb/>with him that
            his time was past. He belongs to the<lb/>first half of the nineteenth century, not to
            the second.<lb/>I think that your friend himself was moved when I<lb/>took his wasted
            hands in mine with the pressure of<lb/>farewell. For three months now his attendants
            have<lb/>remarked his failing strength, and perhaps the old<lb/>man had the same
            foreboding as myself at parting<lb/>that I might be the last ambassador of European
            line-<lb/>age who should penetrate the depths of the wilderness<lb/>to offer him
            regard, love and thanks, in the name of<lb/>that science which owes so much to his
            labors. I<lb/>mounted my horse and rode northward through the<lb/>evergreen plains. No
            path showed my way, no guide<lb/>disturbed me; I was alone with my sorrowful
            thoughts<lb/>over the departed Bonpland.</p>
                    <p>Yet how cheerful the last latter I received from Bon-<lb/>pland, bearing date
            the 7th of June, 1857! &#x201C;I my-<lb/>self,&#x201D; he writes, &#x201C;shall bring
            all my collections and<lb/>manuscripts to Paris, and deposit them in the Muse-<lb/>um.
            My journey to France will be exceedingly short.<lb/>I shall return to my Santa Anna,
            where I lead a quiet<lb/>and happy life. Here shall I die, and my sepulchre<lb/>and my
            grave shall be underneath the shadow of the<lb/>many trees I have planted. Oh, how happy
            were I, my<lb/>dear Humboldt, could we meet once more, and recall<lb/>our common
            experiences! On the 28th of August next<lb/>I shall be eighty-four years old, and am yet
            four years<lb/>younger than you. A man lately died in this vicinity<lb/>who had attained
            the age of one hundred and seven.<lb/>What a prospect for two travelers who have
            already<lb/>stepped beyond the eightieth year!&#x201D;</p>
                    <p>The cheerful, almost life-desiring tone of this letter,<lb/>contrasts
            strangely with the melancholy representa-<lb/>tions of Dr. Lallemant. According to Herr
            v. Tschudi<lb/>the report was credited in Montevideo on the 29th of<lb/>May that
            Bonpland had died at Borgia, the date<lb/>of his death uncertain. Yet Dr. Lallemant had
            spoken<lb/>with him on the 18th of April in Santa Anna, and on<lb/>May 19 the report of
            his death was discredited at Porto<lb/>Allegro. Thus there yet remains ground for hope
            that<lb/>the younger is not to be first called away. Such re-<lb/>moteness often
            stretches uncertainty to a painful dura-<lb/><cb/>tion; such the solicitude felt for
            Edward Vogel in<lb/>Central Africa, and for Adolphus Schlagintweit in<lb/>Central
            Asia&#x2014;the sorrowfully missed!</p>

                        <p>It is a touching and noble sight&#x2014;that of the
                        &#x201C;old<lb/>master of science,&#x201D; as ther Germans delight to call
                        him,<lb/>turning with calm resignation from the graves of his<lb/>dearest
                        friends, and quietly addressing himself once<lb/>more to the great work of
                        his life, from which nothing<lb/>is suffered to divert his mind. He is still
                        hale and<lb/>full of vigor, loves the society of congenial friends,<lb/>and
                        is especially pleased to receive visitors from Amer-<lb/>ica. No other man
                        of science ever won such a hold<lb/>upon the heart of mankind, and though
                        all the world<lb/>will sympathize with him in his present
                        bereavement,<lb/>there is no one but will rejoice that he is still
                        allowed<lb/>to remain among us, the noblest man that lives.<lb/></p>
