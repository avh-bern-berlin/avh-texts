                    narrative; and belong to a work so universally celebrated, that we need only
                    say, they are, if possible, more thickly studded with pieces of valuable
                    information and curious matter, than the parts which have preceded

                    grow beneath their shoulders, he told the marvellous stories. Our author is
                    hardly a trace behind him; and, like the fair Desdemona, we, with greedy ear,
                    devour up his discourse; whence, without further preface, we shall now proceed
                    to draw for the benefit of our readers.</p><p>The natives near the cataracts or
                    raudales of the Oroonoko, up which river M. de Humboldt made his way to a height
                    little known to Europeans, are distinguished by several remarkable prejudices,
                    among which, none are more fatal than those narrated in the following:&#x2014;
                    </p><p>&#x201C;Among the causes of the depopulation of the Raudales, I have not
                    reckoned the small pox; that malady which, in other parts of America, makes such
                    cruel ravages, that the natives, seized with dismay, burn their huts, kill their
                    children, and renounce every kind of society.<note place="foot" n="*">As the

                        the American travellers, Clark and Lewis.</note> This scourge is almost
                    unknown on the banks of the Oronoko. What depopulates the Christian settlements
                    is, the repugnance of the Indians for the regulations of the missions, the
                    insalubrity of a climate at once hot and damp, bad nourishment, want of care in
                    the diseases of children, and the guilty practice of mothers of preventing
                    pregnancy by the use of deleterious herbs. Among the barbarous people of Guyana,
                    as well as those of the half-civilized islands of the <cb/>South Sea, young
                    wives will not become mothers. If they have children, their offspring are
                    exposed, not only to the dangers of savage life, but also to the dangers arising
                    from the strangest popular prejudices. When twins are born, false notions of
                    propriety and family honour require, that one of them should be destroyed.
                    &#x2018;To bring twins into the world, is to be exposed to public scorn; it is
                    to resemble rats, opossums, and the vilest animals, which bring forth a great
                    number of young at a time.&#x2019; Nay more: &#x2018;two children born at the
                    same time cannot belong to the same father.&#x2019; This is an axiom of
                    physiology of the Salivas; and in every zone, and in different states of
                    society, when the vulgar seize upon an axiom, they adhere to it with more
                    stedfastness than the better informed men, by whom it was first hazarded. To
                    avoid a disturbance of conjugal tranquillity, the old female relations of the
                    mother, or the <hi rendition="#i">mure japoic-nei</hi> (midwives,) take care,
                    that one of the twins shall disappear. If the new-born infant, though not a
                    twin, have any physical deformity, the father instantly puts it to death. They
                    will have only robust and well-made children, for deformities indicate some
                    influence of the evil spirit Ioloquiamo, or the bird <hi rendition="#i"
                        >Tikitiki</hi>, the enemy of the human race. Sometimes children of a feeble
                    constitution undergo the same fate. When the father is asked, what is become of
                    one of his sons, he will pretend, that he has lost him by a natural death. He
                    will disavow an action, that appears to him blameable, but not criminal.
                    &#x2019;The poor <hi rendition="#i">mure</hi>,<note place="foot" n="*">In
                        Tamanack <hi rendition="#i">mure</hi> signifies a child; <hi rendition="#i"
                            >emuru</hi>, a son.</note>&#x201D; he will tell you, &#x2019;could not
                    follow us; we must have waited for him every moment; he has not been seen again,
                    he did not come to sleep where we passed the night.&#x2019; Such is the candour
                    and simplicity of manners, such the boasted happiness of man in the <hi
                        rendition="#i">state of nature</hi>! He kills his son, to escape the
                    ridicule of having twins, or to avoid journeying more slowly; in fact, to avoid
                    a little inconvenience.&#x201D;</p><p>Amid the prodigality and magnificence of
                    nature, such are the moral evils which deform the scene; and we are often
                    compelled to leave the author&#x2019;s glowing descriptions of superb landscape
                    in the torrid zone, to vex our spirits with similar details. But, the able
                    manner in which distant objects and remote similitudes are brought to bear on
                    almost every subject discussed, is the great charm of this work; and we have so
                    vast a quantity of intelligence combined with so rich a fund of amusing
                    anecdote, that the mind never tires. It has been <cb/>alleged, that Mr. H. is
                    too prone to this sort of classification, and to theories built upon it; but
                    however that may be in a philosophical point of view, as a popular performance,
                    it wonderfully enhances the attractions of his narrative. He is, in truth, the
                    very Jacques of travellers; and his way is delectable, &#x201C; compounded of
                    many simples, extracted from many objects; and, indeed, the sundry contemplation
                    of his travels, in which his often rumination wraps him in a most humourous
                    sadness.&#x201D; He morals on every thing; for
                    example:&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201C;The inhabitants of Atures and Maypures, whatever
                    the missionaries may have asserted in their works, are not more struck with
                    deafness by the noise of the great cataracts, than the catadupes of the Nile.
                    When this noise is heard in the plain that surrounds the mission, at the
                    distance of more than a league, you seem to be near a coast skirted by reefs and
                    breakers. The noise is three times as loud by night as by day, and gives an
                    inexpressible charm to these solitary scenes. What can be the cause of this
                    increased intensity of sound in a desert, where nothing seems to interrupt the
                    silence of nature? The velocity of the propagation of sound, far from
                    augmenting, decreases with the lowering of the temperature. The intensity
                    diminishes in air, agitated by a wind, which is contrary to the direction of the
                    sound; it diminishes also by dilatation of the air, and is weaker in the higher
                    than in the lower regions of the atmosphere, where the number of particles of
                    air in motion is greater in the same radius. The intensity is the same in dry
                    air, and in air mingled with vapours; but it is feebler in carbonic acid gas,
                    than in mixtures of azot and oxygen. From these facts, which are all we know
                    with any certainty, it is difficult to explain a phenomenon observed near every
                    cascade in Europe, and which, long before our arrival in the village of Atures,
                    had struck the missionary and the Indians. The nocturnal temperature of the
                    atmosphere is 3° less than the temperature of the day; at the same time the
                    apparent humidity augments at night, and the mist that covers the cataracts
                    becomes thicker. We have just seen, that the hygroscopic state of the air has no
                    influence on the propagation of the sound, and that the cooling of the air
                    diminishes its swiftness.</p>&#x201C;It may be thought, that, even in places not
                inhabited by man, the hum of insects, the song of birds, the rustling of leaves
                agitated by the feeblest winds, occasion, during the day, a confused noise, which we
                perceive the less because it is uniform, and constantly strikes the ear. Now this
                noise, however slightly perceptible it may be, may diminish the intensity of a
                louder, noise; and this diminution may cease, if during the calm of the night the
                song of birds, the hum of insects, and the action of the wind upon the leaves, be
                interrupted. But this reasoning, even admitting its justness, can scarcely be
                applied to the forests of the Oroonoko, where the air is constantly filled by an
                innumerable quantity of moschettoes, where the hum of insects is much louder by
                night than by day, and where the breeze, if ever it be felt, blows only after
                sunset.&#x201D; <p>This hypothesis is well worth further investigations; but we must
                    surrender it to the scientific journals, and continue our more mixed
                    career.</p><p>&#x201C;The Indians of Atures,&#x201D; says Mr. H., &#x201C;are
                    mild, moderate, and accustomed, from the effects of their idleness, to the
                    greatest <cb/>privations. Formerly, excited to labour by the Jesuits, they did
                    not want for food. The fathers cultivated maize, French beans, (<hi
                        rendition="#i">frisoles</hi>), and other European vegetables; they even
                    planted sweet oranges and tamarinds round the villages ; and they possessed
                    twenty or thirty thousand head of cows and horses, in the savannahs of Atures
                    and Carichana. They had at their service a great number of slaves and servants
                        (<hi rendition="#i">peones</hi>), to take care of their herds. Nothing is
                    now cultivated but a little cassava, and a few plantains. The fertility of the
                    soil however is such, that at Atures I counted on a single branch of musa 108
                    fruits, 4 or 5 of which would almost suffice for the daily nourishment of a man.
                    The culture of maize is entirely neglected, and the horses and cows have
                    disappeared. Near the <hi rendition="#i">raudal</hi>, a part of the village
                    still bears the name of <hi rendition="#i">Passo del ganado</hi> (ford of the
                    cattle), while the descendants of those very Indians, whom the Jesuits had
                    assembled in a mission, speak of horned cattle as of animals of a race that is
                    lost. In going up the Oroonoko, toward San Carlos del Rio Negro, we saw the last
                    cow at Carichana. The fathers of the Observance, who now govern these vast
                    countries, did not immediately succeed the Jesuits. During an interregnum of
                    eighteen years, the missions were visited only from time to time, and by
                    Capuchin monks. The agents of the secular government, under the title of <hi
                        rendition="#i">Commissioners of the King</hi>, managed the <hi
                        rendition="#i">hatos</hi> or farms of the Jesuits with culpable negligence.
                    They killed the cattle in order to sell the hides. Many heifers were devoured by
                    tigers, and a greater number perished in consequence of wounds made by the bats
                    of the <hi rendition="#i">raudales</hi>, which are much less, but far bolder
                    than the bats of the Llanos. At the time of the expedition of the boundaries,
                    the horses of Encaramada, Carichana, and Atures, were conveyed as far as San
                    Jose of Maravitanos, where, on the banks of the Rio Negro, the Portugueze could
                    only procure them after a long passage, and of a very inferior quality, by the
                    river Amazon and Grand Para. Since the year 1795, the cattle of the Jesuits have
                    entirely disappeared. There now remains in testimony of the ancient cultivation
                    of these countries, and the industrious activity of the first missionaries, only
                    a few trunks of the orange and tamarind in the savannahs, surrounded by wild
                    trees.</p><p>&#x201C;The tigers, or jaguars, which are less dangerous for the
                    cattle than the bats, come into the village at Atures, and devour the pigs of
                    the poor Indians. The missionary related to us a striking instance of the
                    familiarity of these animals, upon the whole so ferocious. Some months before
                    our arrival, a jaguar, which was thought to be young, though of a large size,
                    had wounded a child in playing with him; I use confidently this expression,
                    which may seem strange, having on the spot verified facts which are not without
                    interest in the history of the manners of animals. Two Indian children, a boy
                    and a girl, about eight and nine years of age, were seated <cb/>on the grass
                    near the village of Atures, in the middle of a savannah, which we have often
                    traversed. At two o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon, a jaguar issued from the
                    forest, and approached the children, bounding around them; sometimes he hid
                    himself in the high grass, sometimes he sprang forward, his back bent, his head
                    hung down, in the manner of our cats. The little boy, ignorant of his danger,
                    seemed to be sensible of it only when the jaguar with one of bis paws gave him
                    some blows on the head. These blows, at first slight, became ruder and ruder;
                    the claws of the jaguar wounded the child, and the blood flowed with violence.
                    The little girl then took a branch of a tree, struck the animal, and it fled
                    from her. The Indians ran up at the cries of the children, and saw the jaguar,
                    which retired bounding, without the least show of resistance.</p><p> &#x201C;The
                    little boy was brought to us, who appeared lively and intelligent. The claw of
                    the jaguar had taken away the skin from the lower part of the forehead, and
                    there was a second scar at the top of the head.&#x201D;</p>&#x201C;It was among
                the cataracts that we began to hear of the hairy man of the woods, called salvaje,
                that carries off women, constructs huts, and sometimes eats human flesh. The
                Tamanacks call it <hi rendition="#i">achi</hi>, and the Maypures <hi rendition="#i"
                    >vasitri</hi>, or <hi rendition="#i">great devil</hi>. The natives and the
                missionaries have no doubt of the existence of this anthropomorphous monkey, which
                they singularly dread. Father Gili gravely relates the history of a lady in the town
                of San Carlos, who much praised the gentle character and attentions of the man of
                the woods. She lived several years with one in great domestic harmony, and only
                requested some hunters to take her back, &#x2018;because she was tired, she and her
                children (a little hairy also), of living far from the church and the
                sacraments.&#x201D; The same author, notwithstanding his credulity, confesses, that
                he had not been able to find an Indian, who asserted positively that he had seen the
                    <hi rendition="#i">salvaje</hi> with his own eyes. This fable, which the
                missionaries, the European planters, and the negroes of Africa, have no doubt
                embellished with many features taken from the description of the manners of the
                ourang outang, the gibbon, the jocko or chimpanzee, and the pongo, pursued us during
                five years from the northern to the southern hemisphere; and we were every where
                blamed, in the most cultivated class of society, for being the only persons to doubt
                the existence of the great anthropomorphous monkey of America. We shall first
                observe, that there are certain regions, where this belief is particularly prevalent
                among the people; such are the banks of the Upper Oroonoko, the valley of Upar near
                the Lake of Maracaybo, the mountains of Santa Martha and of Merida, the provinces of
                Quixos, and the banks of the Amazon near Tomependa. In all these places, so distant
                one from the other, it is repeated, that the <hi rendition="#i">salvaje</hi> is
                easily recognized by the traces of its feet, the toes of which are turned backward.
                But if there exist a monkey of a large size in the New Continent, how has it
                happened, that during three centuries no man worthy of belief has been able to
                procure the skin of one? Several hypotheses present themselves to the mind, in order
                to explain the source of so ancient an error or belief. Has the famous <hi
                    rendition="#i">capuchin</hi> monkey of Esmeralda, the canine teeth of which are
                more than six lines and a half long, the physiognomy much more like man&#x2019;s
                than that of the ourang outang, and which, when irritated, rubs its beard with its
                hand, give rise to the fable of the <hi rendition="#i">salvaje</hi>? It is not so
                large indeed as the coaita (<hi rendition="#i">simia paniscus</hi>); but when seen
                at the top of a tree, and the head only visible, it might easily be taken for a
                human being. It may be also (and this opinion appears to me the most probable), that
                the man of the woods was one of those large bears, the footsteps of which resemble
                those of a man, and which is believed in every country to attack women. The animal
                killed in my time at the foot of the mountains of Merida, and sent, by the name of
                    <hi rendition="#i">salvaje</hi>, to Colonel Ungaro, the governor of the province
                Varinas, was in fact a bear with black and smooth fur.&#x201D;<p>These extraordinary
                    accounts are succeeded by a detailed history of the Moschettoes of this region;
                    perhaps the most remarkable of all its animal phenomena.</p><p>&#x201C;Persons
                    who have not navigated the great rivers of equinoctial America, for instance,
                    the Oroonoko and the Rio Magdalena, can scarcely conceive, how without
                    interruption, at every instant of life, you may be tormented by insects flying
                    in the air, and how the multitude of these little animals may render vast
                    regions wholly uninhabitable. However accustomed you may be to endure pain
                    without complaint, however lively an interest you may take in the objects of
                    your researches, it is impossible not to be constantly disturbed by the
                    moschettoes, <hi rendition="#i">zancudoes, jejens</hi> and <hi rendition="#i"
                        >tempraneroes</hi>, that cover the face and hands, pierce the clothes with
                    their long sucker in the form of a needle, and, getting into the mouth and
                    nostrils, set you coughing and sneezing whenever you attempt to speak in the
                    open air. In the missions of the Oroonoko, in the villages placed on the banks
                    of the river, surrounded by immense forests, the <hi rendition="#i">plaga de las
                        moscas</hi>, the plague of the flies, affords an inexhaustible subject of
                    conversation. When <cb/>two persons meet in the morning, the first questions
                    they address to each other are, &#x2018;How did you find the zancudoes during
                    the night? How are we to day for the moschettoes.&#x2019; These questions remind
                    us of a Chinese form of politeness, which indicates the ancient state of the
                    country where it took birth. Salutations were made heretofore in the <hi

                    country of gold and platina, the Chinese compliment on the serpents might be
                    added to that of the moschettoes.&#x201D;</p><p>Other curious facts are
                    recorded, and illustrate this subject. Mr. H. says&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201C;At
                    Mandavaca we found an old missionary, who told us with an air of sadness, that
                    he bad spent <hi rendition="#i">his twenty years of moschettoes</hi> in America.
                    He desired us to look well at his legs, that we might be able to tell one day,
                    &#x2018;poor alla (beyond sea), what the poor monks suffer in the forests of
                    Cassiquiare.&#x2019; Every sting leaving a small darkish brown point, his legs
                    were so speckled, that it was difficult to recognize the whiteness of his skin
                    through the spots of coagulated blood. If the insects of the simulium genus
                    abound in the Cassiquiare, which has <hi rendition="#i">white waters</hi>, the
                    culices, or <hi rendition="#i">zancudoes</hi>, are so much the more rare; you
                    scarcely find any there, while on the rivers of <hi rendition="#i">black
                        waters</hi>, in the Atabapo and the Rio Negro, there are generally some <hi
                        rendition="#i">zancudoes</hi> and no <hi rendition="#i"
                    >moschettoes</hi>.&#x201D; </p>&#x201C;I have just shown, from my own
                observations, how much the geographical distribution of venomous insects varies in
                this labyrinth of rivers with white and black waters. It were to be wished, that a
                learned entomologist could study on the spot the specific differences of these
                noxious insects, which in the torrid zone, in spite of their littleness, act an
                important part in the economy of nature. What appeared to us very remarkable, and is
                a fact, known to all the missionaries, is, that the different species do not
                associate together, and that at different hours of the day you are stung by a
                distinct species. Every time that the scene changes, and to use the simple
                expression of the missionaries, other insects &#x2018;mount

                you have a few minutes, often a quarter of an hour, of repose. The insects that
                disappear have not their places instantly supplied in equal numbers by their
                successors. From half after six in the morning till five in the afternoon, the air
                is filled with moschettoes; which have not, as we find related in some travels, the
                form of our gnats, but that of a small fly. They are simuliums of the family
                nemocer&#x00E6; of the system of Latreille. Their sting is as painful as that of <hi
                    rendition="#i">stomoxes</hi>. It leaves a little reddish-brown spot, which is
                extravasated and coagulated blood, where their proboscis has pierced the skin. An
                hour before sun-set a species of small gnats, called <hi rendition="#i"
                    >tempraneros</hi>, because they appear also at sun-rise, take the place of the
                moschettoes. Their presence scarcely lasts an hour and a half; they disappear
                between six and seven in the evening, or, as they say here, after the <hi
                    rendition="#i">Angelus</hi>(<hi rendition="#i">a la oracion</hi>). After a few
                minutes repose, you feel yourself stund by <hi rendition="#i">zancudoes</hi>,
                another species of gnat (culex) with very long legs. The zancudo, the proboscis of
                which contains a sharp pointed sucker, causes the most acute pain, and a swelling
                that remains several weeks. Its hum resembles that of our gnats in Europe, but is
                louder and more prolonged. The Indians pretend to distinguish &#x2018;by their
                song&#x2019; the <hi rendition="#i">zancudoes</hi> and the <hi rendition="#i"
                    >tempraneroes</hi>; the latter of which are real <hi rendition="#i">twilight
                    insects</hi>, while the <hi rendition="#i">zancudoes</hi> are most frequently
                    <hi rendition="#i">nocturnal insects</hi>, and disappear towards
                    sun-rise.<p>&#x201C;The <hi rendition="#i">culices</hi> of South America, have
                    generally the wings, corselet, and legs of an azure colour, annulated, and
                    variable from a mixture of spots of a metallic lustre. Here, as in Europe, the
                    males, which are distinguished by their feathered antenn&#x00E6;, are extremely
                    rare; you are seldom stung except by females. The preponderance of this sex
                    explains the immense increase of the species, each female laying several hundred
                    eggs. In going up one of the great rivers of Ameriva, it is observed, that the
                    appearance of a new species of <hi rendition="#i">culex</hi> denotes the
                    approximity of a new stream flowing in.<choice><sic>j</sic><corr
                            type="editorial"/></choice>&#x2019;</p><p>&#x201C;The whites born in the
                    torrid zone walk barefoot with impunity in the same apartment where a European
                    recently landed is exposed to the attack of the <hi rendition="#i">niguas</hi>
                    or <hi rendition="#i">chegoes</hi> (<hi rendition="#i">pulex penetrans</hi>).
                    These animals, almost invisible to the eye, get under the nails of the feet, and
                    there acquire the size of a small pea by the quick increase of its eggs, which
                    are placed in a bag under the belly of the insect. The <hi rendition="#i"
                        >nigua</hi>, therefore, distinguishes, what the most delicate chemical
                    analysis could not distinguish, the cellular membrane and blood of a European
                    from those of a Creole white. It is not so with the
                    moschettoes.</p><p>&#x201C;In the day, even when labouring at the oar, the
                    natives, in order to chase the insects, are continually giving one another smart
                    slaps with the palm of the hand. Rude in all their movements, they strike
                    themselves and their comrades mechanically during their sleep. The violence of
                    their blows reminds us of the Persian tale of the bear, that tried to kill with
                    his paw the insects on the forehead of his sleeping master. Near Maypures we saw
                    some young Indians seated in a circle and rubbing cruelly each others backs with
                    the bark of trees dried at the fire. Indian women were occupied with a degree of
                    patience, of which <cb/>the copper-coloured race alone are capable, in
                    extirpating by means of a sharp bone the little mass of coagulated blood, that
                    forms the centre of every sting, and gives the skin a speckled appearance. One
                    of the most barbarous nations of the Oroonoko, that of the Otomacs, is
                    acquainted with the use of moschetto curtains (<hi rendition="#i"
                        >mosquiteros</hi>) formed of a tissue of fibres of the palm tree, <hi
                        rendition="#i">murichi</hi>. We had lately seen, that at Higuerote, on the
                    coast of Caraccas, the people of a copper colour sleep buried in the sand. In
                    the villages of the Rio Magdalena the Indians often invited us to stretch
                    ourselves with them on ox-skins, near the church, in the middle of the <hi
                        rendition="#i">plaza grande</hi>, where they had assembled all the cows in
                    the neighbourhood. The proximity of cattle give some repose to man. The Indians
                    of the Upper Oroonoko and the Cassiquiare, seeing that Mr. Bonpland could not
                    prepare his herbal, on account of the continual torment of the moschettoes,
                    invited him to enter their oveus, (<hi rendition="#i">hornitos</hi>). Thus they
                    call little chambers, without doors or windows, into which they creep
                    horizontally through a very small opening. When they have driven away the
                    insects by means of a fire of wet brush-wood, which emits a great deal of smoke,
                    they close the opening of the oven. The absence of moschettoes is purchased
                    clearly enough by the excessive heat of stagnant air, and the smoke of a torch
                    of <hi rendition="#i">copal</hi>, which lights the oven during your stay in it.
                    Mr. Bonpland, with courage and patience well worthy of praise, dried hundreds of
                    plants, shut up in these <hi rendition="#i">hornitos</hi> of the
                    Indians.</p><p>By this time we fancy our readers are as well acquainted with the
                    habits of the moschettoes, as if they had been bitten by them all over; and
                    further knowledge being unnecessary, we shall advance to other
                    subjects.</p><p>Above the cataract of Atures, at the mouth of the Rio Calaniapo,
                    Mr. Humboldt gives the following account of an extinct tribe:</p><p>&#x201C;We
                    were shown at a distance, on the right of the river, the rocks that surround the
                    cavern of Ataruipe; but we had not time to visit the cemetry of the destroyed
                    tribe of the Atures. We regretted this so much the more, as father Zea was never
                    weary of talking to us of the skeletons painted with anotta, which this cavern
                    contained; of the large vases of baked earth, in which the bones of separate
                    families appeared to be collected; and of many other curious objects, which we
                    proposed to examine at our return from the Rio Negro.&#x201D;</p><p>At Maypure,
                    higher up, we hear more of the pottery of the Indians:</p>&#x201C;In every part
                of the forests, far from any human habitation, on digging the earth, fragments of
                pottery and delft are found. The taste for this kind of fabrication seems to have
                been common heretofore to the natives of both Americas. To the north of
                Mexico,&#x2014;on the banks of the Rio Gala&#x2014; among the ruins of an Azteck
                city&#x2014;in the United States&#x2014;near the <hi rendition="#i">tumuli</hi> of
                the Miamis; in Florida&#x2014;and in every place where any trace of ancient
                civilization could be found, the soil covers fragments of painted pottery; and the
                extreme resemblances of the ornaments they display is striking. Savage nations, and
                those civilized people, who are condemned by their political and religious
                institutions always to imitate themselves, strive, as if by instinct, to perpetuate
                the same forms, to preserve a peculiar type or style, and to follow the methods and
                processes which were employed by their ancestors. In North America, fragments of
                delft have been discovered in places where lines of fortification are found, and the
                walls of towns constructed by an unknown nation, now entirely extinct. The paintings
                on these fragments have a great similitude to those which are executed in our days
                on earthenware by the natives of Louisiana and Florida. Thus too the Indians of
                Maypure often painted before our eyes the same ornaments as we had observed in the
                cavern of <choice><sic>Ataroipe</sic><corr type="editorial"

                <p>&#x201C;Every hemisphere produces plants of a different species; and it is not by
                    the diversity of climates that we can attempt to explain why equinoctial Africa
                    has no laurineæ, and the New World no heaths; why the calceolariæ are found only
                    in the Southern hemisphere; why the birds of the continent of India glow with
                    colours less splendid than the birds of the hot parts of America; finally, why
                    the tiger is peculiar to Asia, and the ornithorhincus to New Holland. In the
                    vegetable, as well as in the animal kingdom, the causes of the distribution of
                    the species are among the number of mysteries which natural philosophy cannot
                    reach. This science is not occupied in the investigation of the origin of
                    beings, but of the laws according to which they are distributed on the globe. It
                    examines the things that are, the coexistence of vegetable and animal forms, in
                    each latitude, at different heights, and at different degrees of temperature; it
                    studies the relations under which particular organizations are more vigorously
                    developed, multiplied or modified; but it approaches not problems, the solution
                    of which is impossible, since they touch the origin, the first existence of a
                    germ of life. We may add, that the attempts that have been made to explain the
                    distribution of various species on the globe, by the sole influence of climate,
                    date at a period when physical geography was still in its infancy; when,
                    recurring incessantly to pretended contrasts between the two worlds, it was
                    imagined, that the whole of Africa and of America resembled the deserts of
                    Egypt, and the marshes of Cayenne. At present, when men judge of the state of
                    things not from one type arbitrarily chosen, but from positive knowledge, it is
                    ascertained that the two continents, in their immense extent, contain countries
                    that are altogether analogous. There are regions of America, as barren and
                    burning as the interior of Africa. The islands that produce the spices of India
                    are scarcely remarkable for their dryness; and it is not on account of the
                    humidity of the climate, as it has been affirmed in recent works, that the New
                    Continent is deprived of those fine species of laurineæ and myristicæ, which are
                    found united in one little corner of the earth, in the archipelago of India. For
                    some years past, the real cinnamon has been cultivated with success in several
                    parts of the New Continent; and a zone that produces the coumarouna, the
                    vanilla, the pucheri, the pine-apple, the myrtus pimenta, the balsam of tolu,
                    the myroxylon peruvianum, the crotons, the citrosmas, the pejoa, the incienso of
                    the silla of Caraccas, the quereme, the pancratium, and so many majestic
                    liliaceous plants, cannot be considered as destitute of aromatics. Besides, a
                    dry air favours the developement of the aromatic, or exciting properties, only
                    in certain species of plants. The most cruel poisons are produced in the most
                    humid zone of America: and it is precisely under the influence of the long rains
                    of the tropics that the American pimento, capsicum baccatum, the fruit of which
                    is often as caustic and fiery as Indian pepper, vegetates best. From the whole
                    of these considerations, it follows, 1st, that the new continent possesses
                    spices, aromatics, and very active vegetable poisons that are peculiar to
                    itself, differing specifically from those of the ancient world; 2dly, that the
                    primitive distribution of species in the torrid zone cannot be explained by the
                    influence of climate solely, or by the distribution of temperature, which we
                    observe in the present state of our planet; but that this difference of climate
                    leads us to perceive, why a given type of organization developes itself more
                    vigorously in such or such local circumstances. We can conceive, that a small
                    number of the families of plants, for instance the musaceæ and the palms, cannot
                    belong to very cold regions, on account of their internal structure and the
                    importance of certain organs; but we cannot explain why no one of the family of
                    melastomas vegetates north of the parallel of thirty degrees, or why no rose
                    tree belongs to the southern hemisphere. Analogy of climates is often found in
                    the two continents, without identity of productions.&#x201D;</p>

                <p>
                    <p>&#x201C;Its trunk, armed with thorns, is more than sixty feet high; its
                        leaves are pinnated, very thin, undulated, and frizzled towards the points.
                        The fruits of this tree are very extraordinary; every cluster contains from
                        fifty to eighty; they are yellow like apples, grow purple in proportion as
                        they ripen, two or three inches thick, and generally, from abortion, without
                        a kernel. Among the eighty or ninety species of palm-trees peculiar to the
                        New Continent, which I have enumerated in the Nova Genera Plantarum
                        Aequinoctialum, there are none in which the sarcocarp is developed in a
                        manner so extraordinary. The fruit of the pirijao furnishes a farinaceous
                        substance, as yellow as the yolk of an egg, slightly saccharine, and
                        extremely nutritious. It is eaten like plantains or potatoes, boiled or
                        roasted in the ashes, and affords a wholesome and agreeable aliment. The
                        Indians and the missionaries are unwearied in their praises of this noble
                        palm-tree, which might be called the peach-palm. We found it cultivated in
                        abundance at San Fernando, San Balthasar, Santa Barbara, and wherever we
                        advanced towards the south or the east along the banks of the Atabapo and
                        the Upper Orinoco. In those wild regions we are involuntarily reminded of
                        the assertion of Linnaeus, that the country of palm-trees was the first
                        abode of our species, and that man is essentially palmivorous. On examining
                        the provision accumulated in the huts of the Indians, we perceive that their
                        subsistence during several months of the year depends as much on the
                        farinaceous fruit of the pirijao, as on the cassava and plantain. The tree
                        bears fruit but once a year, but to the amount of three clusters,
                        consequently from one hundred and fifty to two hundred fruits.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p>Here, also, is the gigantic bombax … they landed to measure it. &#x201C;The
                        height was nearly one hundred and twenty feet, and the diameter between
                        fourteen and fifteen. This enormous specimen of vegetation surprised us the
                        more, as we had till then seen on the banks of the Atabapo only small trees
                        with slender trunks, which from afar resembled young cherry-trees. The
                        Indians assured that these small trees do not form a very extensive group.
                        They are checked in their growth by the inundations of the river; while the
                        dry grounds near the Atabapo, the Temi, and the Tuamini, furnish excellent
                        timber for building.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p>Thus (as we have stated), interspersed<lb/>with anecdote, does Mr. Humboldt
                        vary his<lb/>entertaining volumes; and that our review<lb>may partake of the
                            character of its subject,</lb><lb>we shall conclude the present division
                            of it</lb><lb>by copying a very affecting story. Where</lb><lb>the
                            Atabapo enters the Rio Temi, the nar-</lb><lb>rative
                            says:</lb><p>&#x201C;Before we reached its confluence, a granitic
                            eminence on the western bank, near the mouth of the Guasacavi, fixed our
                            attention: it is called Piedra de la Guahiba (Rock of the Guahiba
                            woman), or the Piedra de la Madre (Mother's Rock.) We inquired the cause
                            of so singular a denomination. Father Zea could not satisfy our
                            curiosity; but some weeks after, another missionary, one of the
                            predecessors of that ecclesiastic, whom we found settled at San Fernando
                            as president of the missions, related to us an event which excited in
                            our minds the most painful feelings. If, in these solitary scenes, man
                            scarcely leaves behind him any trace of his existence, it is doubly
                            humiliating for a European to see perpetuated by so imperishable a
                            monument of nature as a rock, the remembrance of the moral degradation
                            of our species, and the contrast between the virtue of a savage, and the
                            barbarism of civilized man!</p><p>&#x201C;In 1797 the missionary of San
                            Fernando had led his Indians to the banks of the Rio Guaviare, on one of
                            those hostile incursions which are prohibited alike by religion and the
                            Spanish laws. They found in an Indian hut a Guahiba woman with her three
                            children (two of whom were still infants), occupied in preparing the
                            flour of cassava. Resistance was impossible; the father was gone to
                            fish, and the mother tried in vain to flee with her children. Scarcely
                            had she reached the savannah when she was seized by the Indians of the
                            mission, who hunt human beings, like the Whites and the Negroes in
                            Africa. The mother and her children were bound, and dragged to the bank
                            of the river. The monk, seated in his boat, waited the issue of an
                            expedition of which he shared not the danger. Had the mother made too
                            violent a resistance the Indians would have killed her, for everything
                            is permitted for the sake of the conquest of souls (la conquista
                            espirituel), and it is particularly desirable to capture children, who
                            may be treated in the Mission as poitos, or slaves of the Christians.
                            The prisoners were carried to San Fernando, in the hope that the mother
                            would be unable to find her way back to her home by land. Separated from
                            her other children who had accompanied their father on the day in which
                            she had been carried off, the unhappy woman showed signs of the deepest
                            despair. She attempted to take back to her home the children who had
                            been seized by the missionary; and she fled with them repeatedly from
                            the village of San Fernando. But the Indians never failed to recapture
                            her; and the missionary, after having caused her to be mercilessly
                            beaten, took the cruel resolution of separating the mother from the two
                            children who had been carried off with her. She was conveyed alone to
                            the missions of the Rio Negro, going up the Atabapo. Slightly bound, she
                            was seated at the bow of the boat, ignorant of the fate that awaited
                            her; but she judged by the direction of the sun, that she was removing
                            farther and farther from her hut and her native country. She succeeded
                            in breaking her bonds, threw herself into the water, and swam to the
                            left bank of the Atabapo. The current carried her to a shelf of rock,
                            which bears her name to this day. She landed and took shelter in the
                            woods, but the president of the missions ordered the Indians to row to
                            the shore, and follow the traces of the Guahiba. In the evening she was
                            brought back. Stretched upon the rock (la Piedra de la Madre) a cruel
                            punishment was inflicted on her with those straps of manatee leather,
                            which serve for whips in that country, and with which the alcaldes are
                            always furnished. This unhappy woman, her hands tied behind her back
                            with strong stalks of mavacure, was then dragged to the mission of
                            Javita.</p><p>&#x201C;She was there thrown into one of the
                            caravanserais, called las Casas del Rey. It was the rainy season, and
                            the night was profoundly dark. Forests till then believed to be
                            impenetrable separated the mission of Javita from that of San Fernando,
                            which was twenty-five leagues distant in a straight line. No other route
                            is known than that by the rivers; no man ever attempted to go by land
                            from one village to another. But such difficulties could not deter a
                            mother, separated from her children. The Guahiba was carelessly guarded
                            in the caravanserai. Her arms being wounded, the Indians of Javita had
                            loosened her bonds, unknown to the missionary and the alcaldes. Having
                            succeeded by the help of her teeth in breaking them entirely, she
                            disappeared during the night; and at the fourth sunrise was seen at the
                            mission of San Fernando, hovering around the hut where her children were
                            confined. "What that woman performed," added the missionary, who gave us
                            this sad narrative, "the most robust Indian would not have ventured to
                            undertake!" She traversed the woods at a season when the sky is
                            constantly covered with clouds, and the sun during whole days appears
                            but for a few minutes. Did the course of the waters direct her way? The
                            inundations of the rivers forced her to go far from the banks of the
                            main stream, through the midst of woods where the movement of the water
                            is almost imperceptible. How often must she have been stopped by the
                            thorny lianas, that form a network around the trunks they entwine! How
                            often must she have swum across the rivulets that run into the Atabapo!
                            This unfortunate woman was asked how she had sustained herself during
                            four days. She said that, exhausted with fatigue, she could find no
                            other nourishment than those great black ants called vachacos, which
                            climb the trees in long bands, to suspend on them their resinous nests.
                            We pressed the missionary to tell us whether the Guahiba had peacefully
                            enjoyed the happiness of remaining with her children; and if any
                            repentance had followed this excess of cruelty. He would not satisfy our
                            curiosity; but at our return from the Rio Negro we learned that the
                            Indian mother was again separated from her children, and sent to one of
                            the missions of the Upper Orinoco. There she died, refusing all kind of
                            nourishment, as savages frequently do in great
                            calamities.</p><p>&#x201C;Such is the remembrance annexed to this fatal
                            rock, the Piedra de la Madre.</p></p>
