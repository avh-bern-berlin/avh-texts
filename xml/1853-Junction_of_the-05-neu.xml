                    above subject, says:<lb/>&#x201C;Everything depends upon energy and
                    perseverance. I<lb/>therefore congratulate you, sir, and your
                    courageous<lb/>friend Mr. Cullen, as well as Sir Charles Fox, Mr.
                    Hen-<lb/>derson, and Mr. Brassey, for having given your names to<lb/>so noble an

                    such a<lb/>work as the one you contemplate will bring Eastern Asia<lb/>nearer to
                    the nations of Europe and America. It will render<lb/>the whole globe more easy
                    to be travelled over; this little<lb/>globe, of which Christopher Columbus, in
