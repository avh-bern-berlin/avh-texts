                <p>WHERE the Atabapo enters the Rio Temi, and before reaching its<lb break="yes" />confluence, a granitic hummock, that rises on the western bank, near<lb break="yes"/>the mouth of the Guasacavi, fixed our attention; it is called the <hi rendition="#i">Rock<lb break="yes"/>of the Guahiba woman</hi>, or the Rock of the Mother, <hi rendition="#i">Piedra de la Madre.</hi>
                    <lb break="yes"/>We inquired the cause of so singular a denomination. Father Zea<lb break="yes"/>could not satisfy our curiosity; but some weeks after, another mission-<lb break="no"/>ary, one of the predecessors of this ecclesiastic, whom we found settled<lb break="yes"/>at San Fernando as president of the missions, related to us an event,<lb break="yes"/>which I recorded in my journal, and which excited in our minds the<lb break="yes"/>most painful feelings. If, in these solitary scenes, man scarcely leaves<lb break="yes" />behind him any trace of his existence, it is doubly humiliating for a<lb break="yes"/>European to see perpetuated by the name of a rock, by one of those<lb break="yes"/>imperishable monuments of nature, the remembrance of the moral de-<lb break="no"/>gradation of our species, and the contrast between the virtue of a sa-<lb break="no"/>vage, and the barbarism of civilized man!</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>In 1797 the missionary of San Fernando had led his Indians to<lb break="yes"/>the banks of the Rio Guaviare, on one of those hostile incursions<lb break="yes" />which are prohibited alike by religion and the Spanish laws. They<lb break="yes"/>found in an Italian hut, a Guahiba mother with three children, two<lb break="yes"/>of whom were still infants. They were occupied in preparing the<lb break="yes"/>flour of Casava. Resistance was impossible; the father was gone to<lb break="yes"/>fish, and the mother tried in vain to flee with her children. Scarcely<lb break="yes"/>had she reached the Savannah, when she was seized by the Indians of<lb break="yes"/>the mission, who go to <hi rendition="#i">hunt men</hi>, like the whites and the negroes in<lb break="yes"/>Africa. The mother and her children were bound, and dragged to<lb break="yes"/>the bank of the river. The monk, seated in his boat, waited the issue<lb break="yes"/>of an expedition, of which he partook not the danger. Had the mo-<lb break="no"/>ther made too violent a resistance, the Indians would have killed her,<lb break="yes"/>for every thing is permitted when they go to the conquest of souls<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">(à la conquista espiritual)</hi>, and it is children in particular they seek to<lb break="yes"/>capture, in order to treat them, in the mission, as <hi rendition="#i">poitos</hi>, or slaves of<lb break="yes"/>the Christians. The prisoners were carried to San Fernando in the<lb break="yes" />hope, that the mother would be unable to find her way back to her<lb break="yes"/>home by land. Far from those children who had accompanied their<lb break="yes"/>father on the day in which she had been carried off, this unhappy<lb break="yes"/>woman showed signs of the deepest despair. She attempted to take<lb break="yes"/>back to her family the children who had been snatched away by<lb break="yes"/>the missionary, and fled with them repeatedly from the village<lb break="yes"/>of San Fernando, but the Indians never failed to seize her anew;<lb break="yes"/>and the missionary, after having caused her to be mercilessly beat-<lb break="no"/>en, took the cruel resolution of separating the mother from the two<lb break="yes"/>children, who had been carried off with her. She was conveyed<lb break="yes"/>alone toward the missions of the Rio Negro, going up the Atabapo.<lb break="yes"/>Slightly bound, she was seated at the bow of the boat, ignorant of the<lb break="yes"/>fate that awaited her; but she judged by the direction of the sun, that<lb break="yes"/>she was removed farther and farther from her hut and her native coun-<lb break="no" />try. She succeeded in breaking her bonds, threw herself into the water,<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="330" facs="#f0002"/> and swam to the left bank of the Atabapo. The current carried her to a<lb break="yes"/>shelf of rock, which bears her name to this day. She landed and took<lb break="yes"/>shelter in the woods, but the president of the missions ordered the In-<lb break="no"/>dians to row to the shore, and follow the traces of the Guahibi. In the<lb break="yes"/>evening she was brought back. Stretched upon the rock <hi rendition="#i">(la Piedra de<lb break="yes"/>la Madre)</hi> a cruel punishment was inflicted on her with those straps of<lb break="yes"/>Manatee leather, which serve for whips in that country, and with which<lb break="yes"/>the alcades are always furnished. This unhappy woman, her hands<lb break="yes"/>tied behind her back with strong stalks of <hi rendition="#i">mavacure</hi>, was then dragged<lb break="yes"/>to the mission of Javita.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>She was there thrown into one of the caravanseras that are called<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">Casa del Rey.</hi> It was the rainy season, and the night was profoundly<lb break="yes"/>dark. Forests, till then believed to be impenetrable, separated the<lb break="yes"/>mission of Javita from that of San Fernando, which was twenty-five<lb break="yes"/>leagues distant in a straight line. No other part is known than that of<lb break="yes"/>the rivers; no man ever attempted to go by land from one village to<lb break="yes"/>another, were they only a few leagues apart. But such difficulties do<lb break="yes"/>not stop a mother, who is separated from her children. Her children<lb break="yes"/>are at San Fernando de Atabapo; she must find them again, she<lb break="yes"/>must execute her project of delivering them from the hands of Christ-<lb break="no" />ians, of bringing them back to their father on the banks of the Guaviare.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The Guahibi was carelessly guarded in the caravansera. Her arms<lb break="yes" />being wounded, the Indians of Javita had loosened her bonds, unknown<lb break="yes"/>to the missionary and the alcades. She succeeded by the help of her<lb break="yes"/>teeth in breaking them entirely; disappeared during the night; and at<lb break="yes"/>the fourth rising sun was seen at the mission of San Fernando, hover-<lb break="no"/>ing around the hut where her children were confined. &#x201C;What that wo-<lb break="no"/>man performed,&#x201D; added the missionary who gave us this sad narrative,<lb break="yes"/>&#x201C;the most robust Indian would not have ventured to undertake. She<lb break="yes" />traversed the woods at a season when the sky is constantly covered with<lb break="yes"/>clouds, and the sun during whole days appears but for a few minutes.<lb break="yes"/>Did the course of the waters direct her way? The inundations of the<lb break="yes"/>rivers forced her to go far from the banks of the main stream, through<lb break="yes"/>the midst of woods where the movement of the waters is almost imper-<lb break="no"/>ceptible. How often must she have been stopped by the thorny lianas,<lb break="yes"/>that form a network around the trunks they entwine! How often must<lb break="yes"/>she have swum across the rivulets, that run into the Atabapo! This<lb break="yes"/>unfortunate woman was asked how she had sustained herself during the<lb break="yes"/>four days! She said, that, exhausted with fatigue, she could find no<lb break="yes"/>other nourishment than those great black ants called <hi rendition="#i">vachacos</hi>, which<lb break="yes"/>climb the trees in long bands, to suspend on them their resinous nests.&#x201D;<lb break="yes"/>We pressed the missionary to tell us, whether the Guahibi had peace-<lb break="no"/>fully enjoyed the happiness of remaining with her children; and if any<lb break="yes"/>repentance had followed this excess of cruelty. He would not satisfy<lb break="yes"/>our curiosity; but at our return from the Rio Negro we learnt, that the<lb break="yes"/>Indian mother was not allowed time to cure her wounds, but was again<lb break="yes" />separated from her children, and sent to one of the missions of the<lb break="yes"/>Upper Oronooko. There she died, refusing all kind of nourishment,<lb break="yes"/>as the savages do in great calamities.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Such is the remembrance annexed to this fatal rock, to <hi rendition="#i">Piedra de<lb break="yes"/>la Madre.</hi>
