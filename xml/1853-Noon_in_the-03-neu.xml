                                                  undulate, from the effect of<lb/>mirage, without a
                                                  breath of wind being left. The sun was
                                                  near<lb/>the zenith, and its dazzling light,
                                                  reflected from the surface of<lb/>the river,
                                                  contrasted with the reddish vapours that
                                                  enveloped<lb/>every surrounding object. How vivid
                                                  is the impression pro-<lb/>duced by the calm of
                                                  nature, at noon, in these burning
                                                  climates.<lb/>The beasts of the forests retire to
                                                  the thickets; the birds hide<lb/>themselves
                                                  beneath the foliage of the trees, or in the
                                                  crevices of<lb/>the rocks. Yet, amidst this
                                                  apparent silence, when we lend an<lb/>attentive
                                                  ear to the most feeble sounds trausmitted through
                                                  the<lb/>air, we hear a dull vibration, a continual
                                                  murmur, a hum of<lb/>insects, filling, if we may
                                                  use the expression, all the lower<lb/>strata of
                                                  the air. Myriads of insects creep upon the soil
                                                  and<lb/>flutter round the plants parched by the
                                                  beat of the sun. A<lb/>confused noise issues from
                                                  every bush, from the decayed trunks<lb/>of trees,
                                                  from the clefts of rocks, and from the ground
