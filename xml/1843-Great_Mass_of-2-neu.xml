<div n="1"><head><hi rendition="#k">Mass of Gold in Russia.</hi></head><p>&#x2014;The auri-<lb/>ferous alluvia of Tzarevo-Nikolaefsk and<lb/>of Tzarevo-Alexandrofsk had
                    already<lb/>furnished a product of 400 poods (the<lb/>pood is 36 pounds
                    avoirdupois), when new<lb/>researches were commenced in the neigh-<lb/>bourhood,
                    especially near the rivulet Tach-<lb/>kou-Targanka, which soon gave rise
                    to<lb/>the discovery of a bed of auriferous sand<lb/>of a very rich nature, but
                    very limited in<lb/>extent. This bed being worked out, the<lb/>waters of a pond
                    which had served for<lb/>washing the sands were let off, and its bot-<lb/>tom
                    was explored. Here was discovered,<lb/>an alluvium of more than eight
                    zolotniks<lb/>(one zolotnik = 65&#x215D; grains) in 100 poods.<lb/>All the
                    valley of Tachkou-Targanka was<lb/>now explored, except the spot on
                    which<lb/>stood the workshops for washing the sand.<lb/>In 1842 it was resolved
                    to destroy these<lb/>shops, and after having washed the soil<lb/>(of prodigious
                    richness, containing in a<lb/>small compass as much as 70 zolotniks per<lb/>100
                    poods of sand), there was discovered,<lb/>on the 7th of November, 1842, under
                    the<lb/>very corner of the building, at three mè-<lb/>tres (ten feet depth),
                    resting upon a stra-<lb/>tum of diorite, the monster-lump, weighing<lb/>two
                    poods, seven Russian pounds, and 92<lb/>zolotniks (79 lbs. 1625 dec.).</p></div><lb/></body><back></back>
