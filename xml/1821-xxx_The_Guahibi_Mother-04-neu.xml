                <p>&#x201C;In 1797, the missionary of San Fernando had led<lb/>his Indians to the
                    banks of the Rio Guaviare, on one<lb/>of those hostile incursions, which are
                    prohibited<lb/>alike by religion and the Spanish laws. They found<lb/>in an
                            <choice><sic>Italian</sic><corr type="editorial">Indian</corr></choice>
                    hut, a Guahiba mother with three chil-<lb/>dren, two of whom were still infants.
                    They were<lb/>occupied in preparing the flour of Cassava. Resis-<lb/>tance was
                    impossible; the father was gone to fish,<lb/>and the mother tried in vain to
                    flee with her children.<lb/>Scarcely had she reached the savannah, when
                    she<lb/>was seized by the Indians of the mission, who go to<lb/>hunt men like
                    the whites and the negroes in Africa.<lb/>The mother and her children were
                    bound, and drag-<lb/>ged to the bank of the river. The monk seated in<lb/>his
                    boat waited the issue of an expedition, of which<lb/>he partook not the danger.
                    Had the mother made<lb/>too violent a resistance, the Indians would have
                    kil-<lb/>led her, for every thing is permitted when they go<lb/>to the conquest
                    of souls (<hi rendition="#i">a la conquista espiritual,</hi>)<lb/>and it is
                    children in particular they seek to capture,<lb/>in order to treat them, in the
                    mission, as <hi rendition="#i">portos,</hi> or<lb/>slaves of the Christians. The
                    prisoners were<lb/>carried to San Fernando in the hope, that the moth-<lb/>er
                    would be unable to find her way back to her home,<lb/>by land. Far from those
                    children who had accom-<lb/>panied their father on the day in which she had
                    been<lb/>carried off, this unhappy woman showed signs of the<lb/>deepest
                    despair. She attempted to take back to<lb/>her family the children who had been
                    snatched away<lb/>by the missionary, and fled with them repeatedly<lb/>from the
                    village of San Fernando, but the Indians<lb/>never failed to seize her anew; and
                    the missionary,<lb/>after having caused her to be mercilessly beaten,<lb/>took
                    the cruel resolution of separating the mother<lb/>from the two children who had
                    been carried off<lb/><cb/>with her. She was conveyed alone towards the
                    mis-<lb/>sions of the Rio Negro, going up the Atabapo&#x2014;<lb/>Slightly bound
                    she was seated at the bow of the<lb/>boat, ignorant of the fate that awaited
                    her; but she<lb/>judged by the direction of the sun that she was re-<lb/>moved
                    farther and farther from her hut and her na-<lb/>tive country. She succeeded in
                    breaking her bonds,<lb/>threw herself into the water, and swam to the
                    left<lb/>bank of the Atabapo.&#x2014;The current carried her to<lb/>a shelf of
                    rock, which bears her name to this day.<lb/>She landed and took shelter in the
                    woods, but the<lb/>president of the missions ordered the Indians to row<lb/>to
                    the shore, and follow the traces of the Guahibi.<lb/>In the evening she was
                    brought back. Stretched up-<lb/>on the rock (<hi rendition="#i">la Piedra de la
                        Madre</hi>) a cruel punish-<lb/>ment was inflicted on her with those straps
                    of mana-<lb/>tee leather, which serve for whips in that country,<lb/>and with
                    which the alcades are always furnished.<lb/>This unhappy woman, her hands tied
                    behind her<lb/>back with strong stalks of <hi rendition="#i">maracure,</hi> was
                    then drag-<lb/>ged to the mission of Javita.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;She was there thrown into one of the caravan-<lb/>seras that are called
                        <hi rendition="#i">Casa del rey</hi>&#x2014;It was the rainy<lb/>season, and
                    the night was profoundly dark. Forests,<lb/>till then believed to be
                    impenetrable, separated the<lb/>mission of Javita from that of San Fernando,
                    which<lb/>was 25 leagues distant in a straight line&#x2014;No other<lb/>part is
                    known than that of the rivers; no man ever<lb/>attempted to go by land from one
                    village to another<lb/>were they only a few leagues apart. But such
                    diffi-<lb/>culties do not stop a mother, who is separated from<lb/>her children.
                    Her children are at San Fernando de<lb/>Atabapo; she must find them again, she
                    must exe-<lb/>cute her project of delivering them from the hands<lb/>of
                    Christians, of bringing them back to their father<lb/>on the banks of the
                    Guaviare. The Guahibi was<lb/>carelessly guarded in the caravansera. Her
                    arms<lb/>being wounded, the Indians of Javita had loosened<lb/>her bonds,
                    unknown to the missionary and the al-<lb/>cades. She succeeded by the help of
                    her teeth in<lb/>breaking them entirely; disappeared during the<lb/>night; and
                    at the fourth rising sun was seen at the<lb/>mission of San Fernando, hovering
                    around the hut<lb/>where her children were confined.
                            <choice><sic>&#x201C;</sic><corr type="editorial"
                        >&#x2018;</corr></choice>What that wo-<lb/>man performed.&#x2019; added the
                    missionary who gave us<lb/>this narrative. The most robust Indian would not
                    have<lb/>ventured to undertake. She traversed the woods at<lb/>a season when the
                    sky is constantly covered with<lb/>clouds, and the sun during whole days appears
                    but<lb/>for a few minutes. Did the course of the waters di-<lb/>rect her
                    way?&#x2014;The inundations of the rivers for-<lb/>ced her to go far from the
                    banks of the main stream<lb/>through the midst of woods where the movement
                    of<lb/>the waters is almost imperceptible. How often<lb/>must she have been
                    stopped by the thorny lianas,<lb/>that form a net work around the trunks they
                    entwine?<lb/>How often must she have swam across the rivulets,<lb/>that run into
                    the Atabapo? This unfortunate wo-<lb/>man was asked how she had sustained
                    herself during<lb/>the four days! She said, that exhausted with fa-<lb/>tigue,
                    she could find no other nourishment than those<lb/>great black ants called <hi
                        rendition="#i">vachacos</hi>, which climb the<lb/>trees in long bands, to
                    suspend on them their resin-<lb/>ous nests.&#x2019; We pressed the missionary to
                    tell us,<lb/>whether the Guahibi had peacefully enjoyed the<lb/>happiness of
                    remaining with her children; and if<lb/>any repentance had followed this excess
                    of cruelty.<lb/>He would not satisfy us; but at our return from Rio<lb/>Negro we
                    learned, that the Indian mother was not al-<lb/>lowed time to cure her wounds,
                    but was again sepa-<lb/>rated from her children, and sent to one of the
                    mis-<lb/>sions of the Upper Oroonoko. There she died, re-<lb/>fusing all kind of
                    nourishment, as the savages do in<lb/>great calamities.&#x2014;<hi
