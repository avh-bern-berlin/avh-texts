<p><hi rendition="#k">Leopold de Buch</hi>, the celebrated Prussian geologist, died at Berlin<lb/>on
                the 4th inst., in the seventy-ninth year of his age. Baron Alex-<lb/>ander Von
                Humboldt, in communicating the intelligence of his death,<lb/>in a very affecting
                letter to Sir R. Murchison, thus speaks of him:<lb/>&#x201C;He and I were united by
                a friendship of sixty-three years&#x2014;a friend-<lb/>ship which never knew
                interruption. I found him, in 1791, in Wer-<lb/>ner&#x2019;s house in Freiburg, when
                I entered the School of Mines. We<lb/>were together in Italy, in Switzerland, in
                France&#x2014;four months in<lb/>Saltzburg. M. De Buch was not only one of the great
                illustrations<lb/>of his age&#x2014;he was a man of noble soul. His mind left a
                track of<lb/>light wherever it passed. Always in contact with nature
                herself&#x2014;he<lb/>could boast of having extended the limits of geological
                science. I<lb/>grieve for him profoundly&#x2014;without him I feel desolate. I
                consulted<lb/>him as a master: and his affection (like that of Gay Lussac
                and<lb/>that of Arago, who were also his friends) sustained me in my labours.<lb/>He
                was four years my junior&#x2014;and nothing forewarned me of this<lb/>misfortune. It
                is not at the distance of a few hours only from such<lb/>a loss that I can say more
                respecting it.&#x201D;</p><lb/></body><back></back>
