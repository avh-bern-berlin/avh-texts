                    <div><p>You have written to me, my dear sir, as you always<lb/>do, a most amiable letter, but I am not
                    able to give you my opinion upon the pos-<lb/>sibility of the existence of the
                    various kinds of mineral, vegetable, animal, direct<lb/>or indirect cerebral
                    electricity. I have a holy horror of all kinds of pine-wood<lb/>spiritualism and
                    psychographic mysticisms. You increase my horror by the<lb/>ghost of that
                    ephemeric being of reason, which is to receive intelligence from
                    the<lb/>thoughts of those persons who surround the table. You know that Geoffrey
                    Saint<lb/>Hilaire pretends to have sweat the oxyde of thought while in Egypt,
                    and you, my<lb/>dear friend, will say, that my incredulity is the simple
                    consequence of my lazi-<lb/>ness. I submit willingly to this reproach, for I am
                    convinced that the friendship,<lb/>which you always extended to me, will not be
                    diminished if I can be instrumental<lb/>in leading you out of the obscure path
                    of error. I rely on your forgiveness.</p><lb/><closer><salute>A. V. <hi rendition="#k">Humboldt.</hi>&#x201D;</salute></closer></div><lb/></body><back></back>
