<div n="1"><head>A CHEAPER LIGHT THAN GAS.</head><lb/><p>On the road leading to the port, we were forcibly struck<lb/>by a spectacle which our stay of two
                    years in the hottest<lb/>part of the tropics might have rendered familiar to us,
                    but,<lb/>previously, I had nowhere seen such an innumerable<lb/>quantity of
                    phosphorescent insects. The grass that over-<lb/>spread the ground, the branches
                    and foliage of the trees,<lb/>all shone with that reddish and moveable light,
                    which<lb/>varies in its intensity at the will of the animal by which it<lb/>is
                    produced. It seemed as though the starry firmament<lb/>reposed on the savannah.
                    In the hut of the poorest in-<lb/>habitant of the country, fifteen cocuyos,
                    placed in a cala-<lb/>bash pierced with holes, afforded sufficient light to
                    search<lb/>for anything during the night. To shake the calabash<lb/>forcibly is
                    all that is necessary to excite the animal to in-<lb/>crease the intensity of
                    the luminous discs situated on each<lb/>side of its body. The people of the
                    country remark, with<lb/>a simple truth of expression, that calabashes filled
                    with<lb/>cocuyos are lanterns always ready lighted. They are, in<lb/>fact, only
                    extinguished by the sickness or death of the in-<lb/>mates, which are easily fed
                    with a little sugar cane. A<lb/>young woman at Trinidad de Cuba told us that,
                    during a<lb/>long and difficult passage from the main land, she always<lb/>made
                    use of the phosphorescence of the cocuyos when she<lb/>gave suck to her child at
                    night; the captain of the ship<lb/>would allow no other light on board, for fear
                    of the cor-<lb/>sairs.&#x2014;<hi rendition="#i">Humboldt&#x2019;s Travels, Vol.
