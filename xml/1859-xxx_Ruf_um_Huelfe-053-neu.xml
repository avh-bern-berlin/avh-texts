    <p><hi rendition="#k">The Great Naturalist.</hi>&#x2014;Baron de Humboldt<lb/>
        has addressed the following note to the Berlin<lb/>
        journals:&#x2014;&#x201C;Overwhelmed by the number of letters<lb/>
        sent me, which are increasing every day, amount-<lb/>
        ing to from 1600 to 2000 per annum&#x2014;many, too,<lb/>
        being on the most futile subjects, such as demands<lb/>
        for my autograph, and offers to cure me of all<lb/>
        diseases&#x2014;I once more make a public appeal to the<lb/>
        persons who wish me well, and request them not to<lb/>
        occupy themselves so much with what concerns me,<lb/>
        in order that with the diminution of strength,<lb/>
        physical and intellectual, which I experience, I may<lb/>
        be allowed a little leasure for study and composition.<lb/>
        I trust that this step, to which I have recourse with<lb/>
        reluctance, will not be interpreted unkindly.&#x201D;</p><lb/></body><back></back>
