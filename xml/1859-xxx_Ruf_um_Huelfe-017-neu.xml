<div n="1"><head><hi rendition="#k">Baron Humboldt and his Correspondents.</hi></head><p>&#x2014;<lb/>Baron de Humboldt has addressed the following note to the<lb/>Berlin journals:&#x2014;&#x201C;Overwhelmed by the number of letters<lb/>sent me, and which are increasing every day, amounting to<lb/>from 1600 to 2000 per annum; many, too, being on the most<lb/>futile subjects, such as demands for my autograph, and offers<lb/>to cure me of all diseases; I once more make a public appeal<lb/>to the persons who wish me well, and request them not to<lb/>occupy themselves so much with what concerns me, in order<lb/>that with the diminution of strength, physical and intel-<lb/>lectual, which I experience, I may be allowed a little leisure<lb/>for study and composition. I trust that this step, to which<lb/>I have recourse with reluctance, will not be interpreted<lb/>unkindly.&#x201D;</p></div><lb/></body><back></back>
