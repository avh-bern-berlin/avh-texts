<div n="1"><head><hi rendition="#k">Humboldt and American Slavery.</hi></head><p>&#x2014;The fol-<lb/>lowing, from a letter, addressed lately by Alexander von<lb/>Humboldt to
                    Julius Froebel, a German author of some<lb/>distinction, and formerly a member
                    of the Parliament<lb/>at Frankfort, may not be without interest to some of
                    our<lb/>readers, partly from the question of slavery it alludes to,<lb/>and
                    partly from the noble image it exhibits of the un-<lb/>dying earnestness of
                    purpose in that &#x201C;old man elo-<lb/>quent:&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;I should
                    like to live long enough yet to see<lb/>your book &#x2018;On the Political State
                    of America,&#x2019; with<lb/>which you are engaged. May you continue to
                    brand<lb/>that shameful leaning to slavery, and that imposture<lb/>about
                    introducing negroes who are said to become free,<lb/>and which is a means to
                    encourage those negro hunts in<lb/>the interior of Africa. What horrors one is
                    obliged to<lb/>witness, if one has the misfortune of living from <choice>

                    </choice><lb/>to 1858. My book against slavery has not been pro-<lb/>hibited in
                    Madrid, yet in the United States, which you<lb/>call &#x2018;the republic of
                    gentlemen,&#x2019; it could only become<lb/>saleable by the omission of all that
                    concerns the suffer-<lb/>ings of coloured people who, according to my
                    political<lb/>views, are fellow-men entitled to enjoy any amount of<lb/>freedom.
                    I lead an industrious life, chiefly at night,<lb/>being much worried by an
                    ever-increasing and mostly<lb/>uninteresting correspondence. I exist joylessly
                    in my<lb/>89th year, since of so many things towards which I have<lb/>striven
                    ever since my early youth and with ever equal<lb/>warmth, so very little has
                    been fulfilled.&#x201D;</p></div><lb/></body><back></back>
