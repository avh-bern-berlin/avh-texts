                    the <placeName>Rio Vinagre</placeName>. I shall give<lb/>some extracts from the journal of my travels,

                <p>The town of <placeName>Popayan</placeName> is situated in the beautiful valley of<lb/>the <placeName>Rio Cauca</placeName>, on
                    the <placeName>Bogota</placeName> road to <placeName>Quito</placeName>, at the foot of<lb/>the two great volcanos of <placeName>Puracé</placeName>
                    and <placeName>Sotarà</placeName>. These volca-<lb/>nos, almost extinct, and exhibiting only the
                    ph&#x00E6;nomena of<lb/>solfataras, form part of the central chain of the <placeName>Andes</placeName>
                    of <placeName>New<lb/>Granada</placeName>. At 1° 55&#x2032; and 2° 20&#x2032; of north latitude, the
                    group<lb/>of mountains which incloses the sources of the <placeName>Magdalena</placeName>
                    is<lb/>divided into three branches, of which the eastern is
                    continued<lb/>towards <placeName>Timana</placeName> and the <placeName>Nevados of Chita</placeName> and of <placeName>Merida</placeName>;<lb/>the
                    intermediate and central one towards the <placeName>Paramos of<lb/>Guanacas</placeName> and of <placeName>Quimdiù</placeName>;
                    the western towards the platini-<lb/>ferous district of the <placeName>Choco</placeName> and the
                    <placeName>isthmus of Panama</placeName>. In<lb/>ascending from the town of <placeName>Popayan</placeName> to the summit of
                    the<lb/>volcano of <placeName>Puracé</placeName>, M. <persName ref="http://d-nb.info/gnd/">Bompland</persName> and I found at the height<lb/>of 8672
                    feet a little plain (<placeName>Llano del Corazon</placeName>), inhabited by<lb/>poor Indian
                    husbandmen. This plain is separated from the<lb/>rest of the acclivity, with
                    which it would otherwise be con-<lb/>tinuous, by two ravines extremely deep: it
                    is at the edge of<lb/>these precipices that the village of <placeName>Puracé</placeName> is built.
                    Springs<lb/>rise every where from the trachytic rock; each garden is
                        sur-<lb/><lb/><pb n="110"
                        facs="#f0003"/> rounded with a quickset hedge of narrow-leaved
                        euphorbium<lb/>(<hi rendition="#i">lechero</hi>) of the most delicate green.
                    This beautiful verdure<lb/>contrasts in a striking manner with the back-ground
                    of black<lb/>and arid mountains which surround the volcano, and which<lb/>are
                    rent by the effects of the earthquakes.</p>
                <lb/>
                <p>The site of the village is celebrated in the country on account<lb/>of three
                    beautiful cascades (<hi rendition="#i">choreras</hi>) of the <placeName>river of
                    Pusambio</placeName>,<lb/>whose water is acid, and which the people, who know no
                    other<lb/>acid than vinegar, call <hi rendition="#i"><placeName>Rio Vinagre</placeName></hi>, sometimes
                        <hi rendition="#i"><placeName>Gran Vinagre</placeName></hi>.<lb/>This river takes its rise at the
                    height of nearly 10,871 feet, in<lb/>a very inaccessible spot. Although the
                    temperature of the<lb/>water be little different in the lower cascades from that
                    of the<lb/>surrounding atmosphere, it is not less certain that the
                    sources<lb/>of the <placeName>Rio Pusambio</placeName> or <placeName>Vinagre</placeName> are very hot. This fact
                    was<lb/>attested to me by the natives and by the missionary of the<lb/>village
                    of <placeName>Puracé</placeName>. In going to the summit of the volcano I<lb/>saw a column of smoke
                    rise at the place where the acid waters<lb/>make their appearance. I have drawn
                    the second of the falls<lb/>of the <placeName>Vinagre</placeName> (<bibl>plate xxx. of the Views of the
                    Cordilleras</bibl>):<lb/>the water, which opens itself a passage across a cavern,
                    is<lb/>precipitated more than 383 feet in depth. The fall has a
                    very<lb/>picturesque effect; but the inhabitants of <placeName>Popayan</placeName> would be<lb/>better
                    pleased if the river, instead of throwing itself into the<lb/><placeName>Rio Cauca</placeName>, became
                    engulfed in some other crevice; for such<lb/>is the delicacy of constitution of
                    animals which breathe by<lb/>gills, and which absorb the oxygen dissolved in the
                    water, that<lb/>the <placeName>Cauca</placeName> during a course of four leagues is destitute of
                    fish,<lb/>on account of the mixture of its waters with those of the
                    <placeName>Rio<lb/>Vinagre</placeName><note place="foot" n="*">M. <persName ref="http://d-nb.info/gnd/">Caldas</persName> has even attributed to
                        this mixture, doubtless with little<lb/>reason, the absence of goitres in

                    tributary of the <placeName>Gran Vinagre</placeName>. During<lb/>my stay at Popayan, it was an opinion

                    found at more than 12,790 feet high, seem to have<lb/>been thrown up through
                    crevices which have since become<lb/>closed. They are like those of the <hi

                    The weather was dreadful; snow and hail fell. I had a<lb/>great deal of

                        fall, not snow, but red hail. Did it inclose<lb/>those same germs of
                        vegetable organization which have been discovered<lb/>above the polar
                        circle?</note>; the hailstones, from<lb/>five to seven lines in diameter,
                    composed of layers varying in<lb/>translucency. They were not only much
                    flattened towards the<lb/>poles, but so much increased in their equatorial
                    diameter,<lb/>that rings of ice separated themselves on the least shock.

                    admitted that the successive layers which are<lb/>added to the central nucleus
                    are in a state of fluidity so great that<lb/>the rotary motion can cause the
                    flattening of the spheroids?</p>
                <lb/>
                <p>When the barometer indicated that we were come very near<lb/>the limit of
                    perpetual snow, we found the masses of sulphur<lb/>disseminated in imperfectly
                    columnar trachytic rocks aug-<lb/>mented. This ph&#x00E6;nomenon struck me the
                    more, as I knew<lb/>how rare sulphur is on the sides of inflamed
                    volcanos:&#x2014;a co-<lb/>lumn of yellowish smoke and a frightful noise
                    informed us of<lb/>the neighbourhood of one of the mouths (<hi rendition="#i"
                        >bocas</hi>) of the volca-<lb/>no. We had some trouble to approach its edge;
                    the declivity<lb/>of the mountain being very steep, and the crevices only
                    covered<lb/>by a crust of sulphur, of whose thickness we were ignorant.
                    We<lb/>believed we might rate the extent of this crust, which is
                    often<lb/>interrupted by rocks, at more than 12,000 square feet.
                    These<lb/>little ridges of trachytic rocks act strongly on the magnet. I
                    tried<lb/>to keep at as much distance from them as possible, to
                    determine<lb/>the inclination of the needle. It was at the town of
                    <placeName>Popayan</placeName><lb/>(height 5825 English feet) 23°,05, centesimal division; at
                    the<lb/><placeName>village of Puracé</placeName> (height 8671 feet) 21°,81; near the summit of<lb/>the
                    <placeName>volcano of Puracé</placeName> (height 14,542 feet) 20°,85. The in-<lb/>tensity of the
                    magnetic force varied very little at <placeName>Popayan</placeName> and<lb/>at the <placeName>village of Puracé</placeName>;
                    and the diminution of the inclination<lb/>is certainly not the effect of the
                    height, as is proved by so<lb/>many other observations which I have made on the
                    summit of<lb/>the <placeName>Andes</placeName>, but the effect of local attractions depending
                    on<lb/>certain centres of action in the trachytes.</p>
                <lb/>
                <p>The mouth of the <placeName>volcano of Puracé</placeName> is a perpendicular<lb/>cleft, the visible
                    opening of which is only 6 feet long and 3<lb/>broad. It is covered in form of a
                    vault by a layer of very<lb/>pure sulphur, which is 18 inches thick, and which
                    the force of<lb/>the elastic vapours has split on the north side. At the
                    distance<lb/>of 12 feet from the mouth we felt an agreeable heat. The
                    cen-<lb/>tigrade thermometer, which had kept till then at 6°,2 (43° F.)<lb/>(a
                    cold not at all considerable in a time of hail, and at a height of<lb/>14,356
                    feet), rose to 15° (61° F.). Placed in such a manner as<lb/>not to be incommoded
                    by the vapours, we had the pleasure of<lb/>drying our clothes. The frightful
                    noise which is heard near<lb/>this opening has almost always the same intensity:
                    it can<lb/>only be compared to that which would be caused by
                    several<lb/>steam-engines together, were the dense steam suffered to<lb/>escape
                    from all at the same moment. We threw great stones<lb/>into the crevice, and we
                    discovered on this occasion that the<lb/><lb/><pb n="114" facs="#f0007"/> opening communicated with a
                    basin full of boiling water.<lb/>The vapours which escape with so much violence
                    are of the<lb/>sulphurous acid, which is indicated by their suffocating
                    smell.<lb/>We shall soon see that the water of the subterraneous lake<lb/>is
                    charged with sulphuretted hydrogen; but the odour of this<lb/>gas is not smelt
                    at the summit of the volcano, because it is<lb/>disguised by the much stronger
                    smell of the sulphurous acid<lb/>vapours. I had not any means of determining the
                    tempera-<lb/>ture of these vapours, which seem to undergo a
                    prodigiously<lb/>strong pressure in the interior of the volcano. As the
                    Indians<lb/>pretend that the opening has several compartments which are<lb/>not
                    all filled with water, and that the noise which is heard at<lb/>times in the
                    interior of the crevice is the forerunner of flames,<lb/>I introduced, by means
                    of a long pole, some papers coloured<lb/>with the tincture of violet, under the
                    vault, where I could be<lb/>sure of not touching the surface of the water.
                    Drawing back<lb/>the pole, I found the papers strongly reddened, but not at
                    all<lb/>inflamed, as was easy to be foreseen.</p>
                <lb/>
                <p>We suceeded after several vain attempts in obtaining some<lb/>water from the
                    crevice: this was by tying a <hi rendition="#i">tutuma</hi> (the fruit
                    of<lb/>the <hi rendition="#i">Crescentia Cujete</hi>) to a stick 8 feet long.
                    The water was<lb/>directly poured into a bottle hermetically stopped. We
                    ex-<lb/>amined it on our return to the village of <placeName>Puracé</placeName>: it exhaled
                    a<lb/>strong smell of sulphuretted hydrogen; it had no acid taste,<lb/>but some
                    weak precipitates caused by the nitrate of silver<lb/>showed the presence of
                    muriatic acid. The crust of sulphur<lb/>which forms above the mouth arises
                    without doubt from the<lb/>contact of the vapours of sulphurous acid with the
                    sulphuretted<lb/>hydrogen which the subterraneous lake disengages. Even
                    the<lb/>water of this lake is covered with a coat of sulphur, which
                    dis-<lb/>appeared in the places where we threw the stones. It results<lb/>from
                    these observations, that only the presence of the muriatic<lb/>acid, or of
                    combinations of this acid with salifiable bases, indi-<lb/>cates a feeble
                    analogy between the waters of <placeName>Rio Vinagre</placeName> and<lb/>those of the lakes. The first,
                    which spring much lower, at the<lb/>declivity of the volcano of <placeName>Puracé</placeName>, are

                    receives its acid in the interior of a volcano<lb/>which abounds in sulphur, and

                <p>The good curate of the village of <placeName>Puracé</placeName> thought to render<lb/>a great
                    service to his parishioners, as well as to the inhabitants<lb/>of the
                    town of <placeName>Popayan</placeName>, in causing, as he said, the <hi rendition="#i">chimneys<lb/>of
                        the volcano</hi> to be cleaned now and then. He ordered the<lb/>Indians to
                    take away the crust of sulphur which rises in form<lb/>of a dome above the
                    crevice. This crust has acquired some-<lb/>times, as they affirm, a thickness of
                    as much as four feet in<lb/>less than two years. It lessens without doubt the
                    opening by<lb/>which the vapours of sulphurous acid escape; but it may
                    be<lb/>conceived that the elastic force of these vapours is such that,<lb/>if
                    the opening were entirely stopped up for some moments,<lb/>it would sooner break
                    the new arch than produce commotions<lb/>by acting against the rocky sides of
                    the volcano. For several<lb/>years the lakes, which represent in miniature the
                        <hi rendition="#i">crater-lakes</hi><lb/>of our extinguished volcanos, seem
                    each to preserve the same<lb/>level of their line of water; which proves that
                    the evaporation<lb/>is equal to the infiltration of the waters of snow and
                    rain:<lb/>but this equilibrium has not always been equally steady.<lb/>About the
                    year 1790 the <hi rendition="#i"><placeName>Boca grande</placeName></hi> caused partial
                    inun-<lb/>dations. I dwell on this ph&#x00E6;nomenon, because it seems
                    to<lb/>throw some light on a problem of the geology of volca-<lb/>nos, which has
                    not been sufficiently examined: I mean the<lb/>ejections of water and mud. At
                    <placeName>Vesuvius</placeName> these ejections<lb/>are only apparent, and come neither from the
                    interior of the<lb/>crater nor from the lateral crevices. An immense
                    electric<lb/>tension manifests itself in the atmosphere which surrounds<lb/>the
                    summit of the volcano at the time of great eruptions.<lb/>Flashes of lightning
                    cleave the air; the aqueous vapours<lb/>thrown out by the crater are cooled;
                    thick clouds envelop the<lb/>summit during the continuance of this storm,
                    confined to a<lb/>little space; the water descends in torrents, and is mixed

                <p>In the volcanos of the <placeName>Andes</placeName> which exceed the limit of per-<lb/>petual snow, the
                    causes of inundations are very different from<lb/>those which we have just
                    indicated. As the eruptions of<lb/>these colossal summits take place only after
                    long intervals<lb/>(every thirty or forty years, or still more rarely), banks of
                    snow<lb/>of an enormous thickness accumulate on the sides of the
                    moun-<lb/>tains. These snows do not melt at the time of the explosion<lb/>only,
                    but sometimes several days before. Thus in February<lb/>1803, during my stay at
                    <placeName>Guayaquil</placeName>, the inhabitants of the<lb/>province of <placeName>Quito</placeName> were frightened at the
                    appearance of the<lb/>cone of <placeName>Cotopaxi</placeName>, which lost a great part of its snows
                    in<lb/>a single night, and showed plainly the black colour of its<lb/>burnt
                    rocks. Whatever idea may be formed of the power<lb/>of the volcanic forces, and
                    of the intensity of the subterraneous<lb/>fires in the <placeName>Andes</placeName>, it cannot be
                    admitted that the thick sides<lb/>of a cone could be uniformly warmed, and
                    transmit the heat<lb/>with such rapidity (by the conductibility of their mass)
                    to the<lb/>outside. The sudden melting of the snows, when, in the
                    <placeName>Cor-<lb/>dilleras</placeName>, it precedes the eruptions, is probably owing only to<lb/>an
                    infinity of little <hi rendition="#i">fumaroles</hi> which disengage hot
                    vapours<lb/>through the fissured rock of the cone. These vapours,
                    accord-<lb/>ing to what I have had opportunity of observing in the cra-<lb/>ters
                    of <placeName>Vesuvius</placeName>, the <placeName>Peak of Teneriffe</placeName>, and the volcano of<lb/><placeName>Jorullo</placeName> in <placeName>Mexico</placeName>,
                    are most frequently pure water, which<lb/>does not act at all on the most
                    sensible re-agents; at other<lb/>times they contain muriatic acid. It is
                    remarked that the<lb/>same crevice gives, at very near epochs, distilled (pure)
                    water<lb/>and very acid waters. The artificial spring which M. <persName ref="http://d-nb.info/gnd/">Gim-<lb/>bernat</persName>
                    has had the ingenious idea of forming at the sum-<lb/>mit of <placeName>Vesuvius</placeName>, by the
                    condensation of the vapours in a glass<lb/>tube, has sometimes shown these
                    variations: they prove either<lb/>the change of chemical action in the interior
                    of the volcano,<lb/>or the accidental opening of some new communications.

                    of<lb/><placeName>&#x00C6;tna</placeName> of March 23, 1536, and March 6, 1755, the sudden<lb/>melting

                    form that resembles the places which are designated by<lb/>that name, and which
                    I have visited; for example, the <hi rendition="#i">solfa-<lb/>taras</hi> of
                    <placeName>Puzzuoli</placeName>, the <placeName>Peak of Teneriffe</placeName>, and the volcano<lb/>of <placeName>Jorullo</placeName> in <placeName>Mexico</placeName>. These
                    last three are craters which<lb/>have vomited lava; they show that their first
                    state was very<lb/>different to that in which we see them at present. With
                    very<lb/>elevated temperatures, the chemical products of a volcano are<lb/>not
                    the same as with a very low temperature. If the appella-<lb/>tion <hi
                        rendition="#i">solfatara</hi> be given indefinitely to every place where
                    sul-<lb/>phur is formed or deposited, this denomination may also be<lb/>applied
                    to a district which I shall describe here, and which<lb/>contrasts singularly
                    with the trachytes of volcanos. In cross-<lb/>ing the <placeName>Cordilleras of the Andes
                    of Quindiu</placeName>, between the ba-<lb/>sins of the <placeName>Cauca</placeName> and of the <placeName>Magdalena</placeName> (lat. 4°
                    50&#x2032;&#x2014;4° 45&#x2032;)<lb/>I saw an immense formation of gneiss and of
                    micaceous schist<lb/>resting immediately on an ancient granite. The layers
                    of<lb/>micaceous schist which alternate with strata of gneiss are free<lb/>from
                    garnets, whilst the gneiss contains many. But, in these<lb/>same primitive
                    micaceous schists, a little to the west of the<lb/>station of the <placeName>Moral</placeName>, at the
                    height of 6800 feet above the<lb/>level of the sea, in the <hi rendition="#i"

                    been recently examined by M.<lb/><persName ref="http://d-nb.info/gnd/">Bouè</persName>. The micaceous schist of <placeName>Quindiu</placeName>, which
                    surrounds the<lb/><hi rendition="#i">open veins</hi>, is decomposed, and the
                    sulphur is formed in masses<lb/>considerable enough to become the object of a
                    sulphur-work<lb/>which supports a family settled in the ravine of the
                    <placeName>Azufral</placeName>.<lb/>The rock contains some decomposed pyrites; but I much<lb/>doubt
                    whether these pyrites perform the important part in<lb/>nature which has been so
                    long ascribed to them in geological<lb/>treatises. In the midst of the granitic
                    rocks of <placeName>Quindiu</placeName> rise<lb/>the trachytes of the volcano of <placeName>Tolima</placeName>, a truncated
                    cone, which<lb/>reminds us of the form of the <placeName>Cotopaxi</placeName>, and which,
                    according<lb/>to a geodesic measurement made by me at the west of <placeName>Ibagué</placeName>,<lb/>is
                    the highest summit of the <placeName>Andes</placeName> in the northern hemi-<lb/>sphere <note

                    that the trachytes which have penetrated the<lb/>granitic rocks also contain
                    sulphur. Two learned travellers,<lb/>MM. <persName ref="http://d-nb.info/gnd/">Rivero</persName> and <persName ref="http://d-nb.info/gnd/">Boussingault</persName>, have recently
                    visited this little<lb/><hi rendition="#i">solfatara in the micaceous
                        schist</hi> of <placeName>Quindiu</placeName>: they have sent<lb/>some specimens to the cabinet of
                    the <hi rendition="#i">Ecole des Mines</hi> at <placeName>Paris</placeName>,<lb/>which contains the
                    most complete and instructive series of <choice><sic>geo-<lb/>ynostic</sic><corr type="editorial">geo-<lb/>gnostic</corr></choice> specimens. Following
                    the <placeName>Cordillera of the Andes</placeName> south-<lb/>wards, these same alternations of
                    primitive formations and of<lb/>porphyritic and trachytic regions are
                    found:&#x2014;but what was my<lb/>surprise, when beyond the equator I
                    ascertained that the cele-<lb/>brated <hi rendition="#i">mountain of sulphur of
                        <placeName>Ticsan</placeName></hi> (S. lat. 2° 10&#x2032;), between<lb/><placeName>Quito</placeName> and <placeName>Cuenca</placeName>, is
                    neither composed of trachyte, nor of<lb/>chalk or of gypsum, but of micaceous
                    schist.</p>
                <lb/>
                <p>This mountain of sulphur, which the Indians call <hi rendition="#i"><placeName>Quello</placeName></hi>,
                    is<lb/>situated, according to my barometric measurement, at the<lb/>height of
                    8000 feet above the level of the ocean. It is entirely<lb/>composed of primitive
                    micaceous schist (<hi rendition="#i">glimmerschiefer</hi>),<lb/>which is not
                    even anthracitic, as are the varieties of this rock<lb/>peculiar to transition
                    countries. In some very deep ravines<lb/>between <placeName>Ticsan</placeName> and <placeName>Alausi</placeName>, the
                    micaceous schist is seen rest-<lb/>ing on gneiss. The sulphur is contained in a
                    stratum of quartz<lb/>which is more than 1200 feet thick: it lies in a tolerably
                    re-<lb/>gular direction N. 18° E., and inclined like the micaceous<lb/><lb/><pb n="120" facs="#f0013"/>
                    schist from 70° to 80° to the north west. The bed of quartz,<lb/>which passes
                    sometimes into the hornstone, is wrought in an<lb/>open working. The declivity
                    of the <hi rendition="#i"><placeName>Cerro Quello</placeName></hi>, on which<lb/>the works were begun
                    some centuries since, is opposite to<lb/>the south-south-east; and the bed of
                    quartz appears to be<lb/>prolonged towards the north-north-west, that is to say,
                    to-<lb/>wards the coast of the <placeName>Pacific Ocean</placeName>. It is however asserted<lb/>that
                    sulphur has not been found on the surface of the ground<lb/>in this direction to
                    the distance of 2000 toises from <placeName>Ticsan</placeName>.<lb/>All is covered there with a thick
                    vegetation. Towards the<lb/>end of the eighteenth century, masses of sulphur
                    were still<lb/>worked, which were from 2 to 3 feet in diameter. At
                    present<lb/>they are working some quartzose strata much less rich, in<lb/>which
                    the sulphur is only dispersed in nodules from 3 to 4<lb/>inches thick. It is
                    observed that the quantity of sulphur in-<lb/>creases with the depth; but the
                    working has been so unskil-<lb/>fully directed that the lower strata are nearly
                    inaccessible.<lb/>The quartz in which the sulphur is dispersed presents
                    neither<lb/>great fissures nor cavities, or <hi rendition="#i">druses;</hi> nor
                    have I been able<lb/>to find any specimen of crystallized sulphur.</p>
                <lb/>
                <p>The mineral which is the object of the working of the <hi rendition="#i"
                        ><placeName>Cerro<lb/>Quello</placeName></hi> does not form a mass or complication of veins, as
                    might<lb/>be supposed: the sulphur is disseminated without any con-<lb/>tinuity
                    by little masses in the quartz which traverses the mi-<lb/>caceous schist in a
                    direction parallel to its strata. The clefts<lb/>that have perhaps formerly
                    united these masses are no<lb/>longer visible, but all the quartz seems to have
                    undergone<lb/>an extraordinary change. It is tarnished, often brittle,<lb/>and
                    breaks in some parts on the least shock; which indicates<lb/>an imperceptible
                    cleavage. The temperature of the rock<lb/>did not differ from that of the
                    exterior air. The inha-<lb/>bitants like to attribute the violent earthquakes to
                    which their<lb/>country has been sometimes exposed to concavities which<lb/>they
                    suppose to exist under the mountain of sulphur. If this<lb/>hypothesis be well
                    founded, it must be admitted that the cause<lb/>which it indicates acts but
                    locally. In the great catastrophe<lb/>of the 4th of February 1797, which
                    destroyed so many thou-<lb/>sand Indians in the province of <placeName>Quito</placeName>,&#x2014;the
                    three places where<lb/>there is the most sulphur, the <placeName>Cerro Quello</placeName>; the A<placeName>zufral
                    of<lb/>Cuesaca</placeName> near to the Villa of <placeName>Ibarra</placeName>, and the <placeName>Machay of Saint-<lb/>Simon</placeName>,
                    near the volcano of <placeName>Antisana</placeName>, were but very feebly<lb/>agitated; but at a much
                    earlier period there has been ex-<lb/>perienced, even on the bed of quartz which
                    includes the sul-<lb/>phur near <placeName>Ticsan</placeName>, an explosion similar to that of a
                    mine.</p>
                <lb/>
                <p>The bed of quartz appears at the surface on the two sides of<lb/>the little river
                    of <placeName>Alausi</placeName>; and facing the <placeName>Cerro Quello</placeName> is<lb/><lb/><pb n="121" facs="#f0014"/> found a little plain, where, in
                    the seventeenth century, was si-<lb/>tuated the village of <placeName>Ticsan</placeName>. The ruins of
                    the church of <hi rendition="#i"><placeName>Pueblo<lb/>Viejo</placeName></hi> are still seen. An
                    earthquake wholly local (for its effects<lb/>were confined to a very small space
                    of country) made the sur-<lb/>rounding hills sink down: a part of the village
                    sunk; another<lb/>part was thrown into the air, as happened at
                    <placeName>Riobamba</placeName>,<lb/>where I found the bones of the unfortunate inhabitants of
                    the<lb/>town thrown on the <placeName>Cerro de la Culca</placeName>, to a height of several<lb/>hundred
                    feet. The Indians of <placeName>Ticsan</placeName> who survived this ca-<lb/>tastrophe constructed
                    their habitations more to the north, far<lb/>from the mountain of sulphur whose
                    neighbourhood they<lb/>dreaded. It may be that the coincidence of these
                    ph&#x00E6;nomena<lb/>of explosion and of the position (<hi rendition="#i"
                        >gisement</hi>) of a substance easy<lb/>to be converted into elastic vapours
                    has only been accidental:<lb/>but it may be also that ancient communications
                    with the interior<lb/>of the globe, those upon which is formed by sublimation
                    the<lb/>immense deposit of sulphur, become re-established from time<lb/>to time,
                    and allow the volcanic forces to shake the surface of<lb/>the soil. Near the
                    ruins of <hi rendition="#i"><placeName>Pueblo Viejo</placeName></hi> of <placeName>Ticsan</placeName> I found a<lb/>hill of
                    gypsum lying above the micaceous schist: as this hill is<lb/>not covered by
                    other formations, it is difficult to decide whether<lb/>the gypsum, partly
                    fibrous and mixed with clay, is primitive,<lb/>like that of <placeName>Val Canaria</placeName>, or
                    transition, like the gypsum of the<lb/><placeName>Tarentaise</placeName>.</p>
                <lb/>
                <p>The abundance of sulphur in primitive countries is a very<lb/>important
                    geological fact, in relation to the study of volcanos<lb/>and of rocks through
                    which the subterraneous fire has opened<lb/>itself a passage. Before I had
                    visited the <placeName>Andes of Quito</placeName> and<lb/>the mountain of <placeName>Ticsan</placeName>, sulphur was known
                    only in the tran-<lb/>sition limestone and gypsum; in the gypsums, marles and
                    mu-<lb/>riatiferous clays of secondary countries, and in the rocks
                    ex-<lb/>clusively called <hi rendition="#i">volcanic</hi>. These different
                    geological situations,<lb/>to which may be added the tertiary districts, very
                    ill explained<lb/>the frequency of the sulphureous vapours exhaled by
                    the<lb/>mouths of the volcanos whose centre of action was placed
                    (and<lb/>doubtless with propriety) very much below the secondary
                    and<lb/>intermediate rocks. In proportion as we become acquainted<lb/>with a
                    greater part of the globe we not only see positive geo-<lb/>gnosy, that is to
                    say, the view of the formations and of the geo-<lb/>logical positions, extended;
                    but even <hi rendition="#i">geogony</hi>, or systematic geo-<lb/>gnosy, the
                    conjectural science which investigates the causes of<lb/>ph&#x00E6;nomena,
                    begins to be founded on the analogy of more<lb/>certain facts. We may have been
                    struck for some time past<lb/>with the little masses of native sulphur which are
                    disseminated<lb/>in some metalliferous veins, and which traverse granitic
                    rocks;<lb/>for example, in <placeName>Schwarzwald</placeName>, near <placeName>Riepoldsau</placeName>. The mountain<lb/><lb/><pb n="122" facs="#f0015"/> of
                    <placeName>Ticsan</placeName> which I have made known, leaves no further doubt<lb/>respecting the
                    existence of sulphur in the primitive districts.<lb/>It has also been lately
                    found in <placeName>Brazil</placeName>, that the chloritic<lb/>quartz formation which covers, in the
                    <placeName>Capitania de Minas<lb/>Geraes</placeName>, the primitive clay-slate, contains both gold and
                    sul-<lb/>phur. Lamin&#x00E6; of this rock strongly heated burn with a<lb/>blue
                    flame. Near to <placeName>Villarica</placeName>, in the district called <placeName>Antonio<lb/>Pereira</placeName>, a schist,
                    of the same age as that on which is super-<lb/>posed the itacolumite or
                    chloritic quartz, contains a calca-<lb/>reous bed traversed by veins of quartz,
                    which the Baron <persName ref="http://d-nb.info/gnd/">d&#x2019;Esch-<lb/>wege</persName> (director of the gold and diamond mines
                    of these coun-<lb/>tries) has found filled with little nodules of pulverulent
                    sulphur.<lb/>All these ph&#x00E6;nomena increase in interest, when we reflect
                    that<lb/>this learned geologist, and also another German traveller<lb/>(M. <persName ref="http://d-nb.info/gnd/">Pohl</persName>)
                    incline to the opinion that gold, micaceous iron, dia-<lb/>monds, euclases,
                    platina, and palladium, which are peculiar<lb/>to the alluvial districts of
                    <placeName>Brazil</placeName>, have been derived either from<lb/>the destruction of the great formation
                    of chloritic quartz, or<lb/>from that of a ferruginous bed (<hi rendition="#i"
                        >itabarite</hi>) which is placed above<lb/>this formation.</p>
