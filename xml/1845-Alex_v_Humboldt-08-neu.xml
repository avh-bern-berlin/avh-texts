                <p>While we maintain the unity of the human species, we,<lb/>at the same time, repel the depressing assumption of supe-<lb/>rior and inferior races of men. There are nations more sus-<lb/>ceptible of cultivation, more highly civilised, more ennobled<lb/>by mental cultivation, than others&#x2014;but none in themselves<lb/>nobler than others. All are in like degree designed for<lb/>freedom; a freedom which, in the ruder conditions of so-<lb/>ciety, belongs only to the individual, but which, in social<lb/>states, enjoying political institutions, appertains as a right<lb/>to the whole body of the community. If we would indi-<lb/>cate an idea, which, throughout the whole course of<lb/>history, has ever more and more widely extended its<lb/>empire, or which, more than any other, testifies to the<lb/>much contested and more misunderstood perfectibility<lb/>of the whole human race&#x2014;it is that of establishing our<lb/>common humanity&#x2014;of striving to remove the barriers<lb/>which prejudice and limited views of every kind have<lb/>erected among men, and to treat all mankind, without re-<lb/>ference to religion, nation, or colour, as one fraternity, one<lb/>great community, fitted for the attainment of one object<lb/>&#x2014;the unrestrained development of the physical powers.<lb/>This is the ultimate and highest aim of society, identical<lb/>with the direction implanted by nature in the mind of man<lb/>towards the indefinite extension of his existence. He<lb/>regards the earth in all its limits, and the heavens, as far<lb/>as his eye can scan their bright and starry depths, as, in-<lb/>wardly, his own; given to him as objects for contempla-<lb/>tion, and as a field for the developement of his energies.<lb/>Even the child longs to pass the hills or the seas which<lb/>enclose his narrow home; yet when his eager steps have<lb/>borne him beyond those limits, he pines, like the plant,<lb/>for his native soil; and it is by this touching and beauti-<lb/>ful attribute of man&#x2014;this longing for that which is un-<lb/>known, and his fond remembrance of that which is lost&#x2014;<lb/>that he is spared from an exclusive attachment to the<lb/>present.&#x2014;<hi rendition="#i">Humboldt&#x2019;s Cosmos.</hi></p>
