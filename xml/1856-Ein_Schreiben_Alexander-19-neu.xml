                <p>Some persons re-<lb/>ported the author of Cosmos to be a believer in<lb/>the
                    mysteries of table-moving, because he had<lb/>approved of the theory of the
                    electricity of the<lb/>nerves, started by Du Boys Reymonds. Dr.<lb/>Jobard
                    thereupon wrote to Humboldt, to ascer-<lb/>tain his opinion about spiritualism,
                    and received<lb/>the following answer:</p>

                <p>You have written to<lb/>me, my dear sir, as you always do, a most amia-<lb/>ble
                    letter, but I am not able to give you my opin-<lb/>ion upon the possibility of
                    the existence of the<lb/>various kinds of mineral, vegetable, animal,
                    di-<lb/>rect or indirect cerebral electricity. I have a holy<lb/>horror of all
                    kinds of pine-wood spiritualism and<lb/>psychographic mysticisms. You increase
                    my<lb/>horror by the ghost of that ephemeric being of<lb/>reason, which is to
                    receive intelligence from the<lb/>thoughts of those persons who surround the
                    ta-<lb/>ble. You know that Geoffrey Saint Hilaire pre-<lb/>tends to have sweat
                    the oxyde of thought while<lb/>in Egypt, and you, my dear friend, will say,
                    that<lb/>my incredulity is the simple consequence of my<lb/>laziness. I submit
                    willingly to this reproach, for<lb/>I am convinced that the friendship, which
                    you<lb/>always extended to me, will not be diminished if<lb/>I can be
                    instrumental in leading you out of the<lb/>obscure path of error. I rely on your
                    forgiveness.</p>
