                    Humboldt, on<lb/>the subject of the projected oceanic canal across the
    Isthmus<lb/>of Darien, will be read with much interest:&#x2014;<lb/>&#x201C;<hi rendition="#k">the
                    isthmus of darien ship-canal.</hi></head><lb/><dateline><hi rendition="#et">&#x201C;Potadam, June 4. 1853.</hi></dateline><lb/><p>&#x201C;Sir,&#x2014;I am very much to blame for having so long<lb/>delayed an answer to the
                    agreeable and interesting dispatch<lb/>that you have been kind enough to forward
                    me, by the<lb/>hands of Mr. Augustus Peterman, so estimable by his
                    cha-<lb/>racter, as well as by the solidity of his geographical<lb/>labours. Dr.
                    Cullen cannot doubt the high importance<lb/>that I would attach to the merit of
                    his courageous and<lb/>useful investigations in the eastern part of the
                    Isthmus<lb/>of Panama; knowing my position and my antedi-<lb/>luvian age, be
                    will receive with indulgence, even<lb/>so late, the expresson of my lively
                    gratitude.<lb/>After having laboured in vain, during half a century,
                    to<lb/>prove the possibility of an oceanic canal, and to point out<lb/>the Gulf
                    of San Miguel and Cupica as the points most<lb/>worthy of attention; after
                    having regretted, almost with<lb/>bitterness, in the last edition of my
                    &#x2018;Aspects of Nature,&#x2019;<lb/>that the employment of the means which
                    the present state<lb/>of our knowledge affords for obtaining precise
                    measurements<lb/>has been so long delayed, I ought, more than any one
                    else,<lb/>to be satisfied to see, at last, my hopes for so noble an
                    enter-<lb/>prise revived. By your publications, sir, and by that of<lb/>Mr.
                    Gisborne, will be originated the great work of<lb/>changing an important part of
                    the commerce of nations,<lb/>and of rendering more accessible the rich
                    countries<lb/>of Eastern Asia and the Indian Archipelago. The<lb/>undertaking is
                    by no means above the intellectual and<lb/>material power which civilised
                    nations have attained to.<lb/>The work should be one to last for ever; it should
                    not com-<lb/>mence with a canal with locks, like the magnificent
                    Cale-<lb/>donian Canal; it must be a really oceanic canal,
                    without<lb/>locks&#x2014;a free passage from sea to sea, across which
                    the<lb/>speed of the navigation will be modified, but not inter-<lb/>rupted, by
                    the difference in height and non-coincidence of<lb/>the tides.</p><lb/><closer><salute>&#x201C;Receive, I pray you, sir, the expression of my highest<lb/>consideration.&#x2014;Yours, &#x0026;c.,<lb/><hi rendition="#et">(Signed) &#x201C;<hi rendition="#k">Alexander von Humboldt.</hi></hi></salute></closer><lb/>
