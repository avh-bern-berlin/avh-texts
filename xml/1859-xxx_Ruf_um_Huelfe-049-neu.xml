    <p><hi rendition="#k">Baron Humboldt and his Correspondents.</hi>&#x2014;<lb/>
        Baron de Humboldt has addressed the following<lb/>
        note to the Berlin journals:&#x2014;&#x201C;Overwhelmed by<lb/>
        the number of letters sent me, and which are in-<lb/>
        creasing every day, amounting to from 1600 to<lb/>
        2000 per annum; many, too, being on the most<lb/>
        futile subjects, such as demands for my autograph,<lb/>
        and offers to cure me of all diseases; I once more<lb/>
        make a public appeal to the persons who wish<lb/>
        me well, and request them not to occupy them-<lb/>
        selves so much with what concerns me, in order<lb/>
        that with the diminution of strength, physical and<lb/>
        intellectual, which I experience, I may be allowed<lb/>
        a little leisure for study and composition. I trust<lb/>
        that this step, to which I have recourse with reluc-<lb/>
        tance, will not be interpreted unkindly.&#x201D;</p><lb/></body><back></back>
