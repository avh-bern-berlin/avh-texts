<div n="1"><head><hi rendition="#k">Influence of Trade.</hi></head><p>&#x2014;The amber trade, which<lb/>was probably first directed to the West Cimbrian<lb/>coasts,
                    and only subsequently to the Baltic and the<lb/>country of the Esthonians, owes
                    its first origin to the<lb/>boldness and perseverance of Ph&#x0153;nician coast
                    naviga-<lb/>tors. In its subsequent extension, it offers, in the<lb/>point of
                    view of which we are treating, a remarkable<lb/>instance of the influence which
                    may be exerted by a<lb/>predilection for even a single foreign production
                    in<lb/>opening an inland trade between nations, and in making<lb/>known large
                    tracts of country. In the same way that<lb/>the Phoc&#x00E6;an Massilians
                    brought the British tin across<lb/>France to the Rhone, the amber was conveyed
                    from<lb/>people to people through Germany, and by the Celts<lb/>on either
                    declivity of the Alps to the Padus, and<lb/>through Pannonia to the Borysthenes.
                    It was this<lb/>inland traffic which first brought the coasts of
                    the<lb/>Northern Ocean into connexion with the Euxine and<lb/>the
                        Adriatic.&#x2014;<hi rendition="#i">Humboldt&#x2019;s Cosmos.</hi></p></div><lb/></body><back></back>
