By Alex-<lb break="no"/>ander de Humboldt, and Aimé Bonpland,<lb break="yes"/>&amp;c. &amp;c. London, 1821, 8vo. 2 Vols.<lb break="yes"/>pp. 864.<lb break="yes"/>These volumes, translated by H. Maria<lb break="yes"/>Williams, terminate the second volume<lb break="yes" />(in quarto) of M. Humboldt&#x2019;s personal<lb break="yes"/>narrative; and belong to a work so univer-<lb break="no"/>sally celebrated, that we need only say,<lb break="yes"/>they are, if possible, more thickly studded<lb break="yes"/>with pieces of valuable information and<lb break="yes"/>curious matter, than the parts which have<lb break="yes"/>preceded them.</p>
                <p>We never take up Humboldt but he re-<lb break="no"/>minds us of Othello, who<lb break="yes"/>&#x2014;Spake of most disastrous chances,<lb break="yes"/>Of moving accidents, by flood, and field;<lb break="yes"/>Of hair-breadth &#x2019;scapes&#x2014;<lb break="yes"/>And portance in his travel&#x2019;s history;<lb break="yes"/>Wherein of antres vast, and <choice><sic>desarts</sic><corr type="editorial">deserts</corr></choice> idle,<lb break="yes"/>Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads<lb break="yes" />touch heaven,&#x2014;<lb break="yes"/>And of the cannibals that each other eat;<lb break="yes"/>The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads<lb break="yes" />Do grow beneath their shoulders,<lb break="yes"/>he told the marvellous stories. Our au-<lb break="no"/>thor is hardly a trace behind him; and,<lb break="yes"/>like the fair Desdemona, we, with greedy<lb break="yes"/>ear, devour up his discourse; whence,<lb break="yes"/>without further preface, we shall now pro-<lb break="no"/>ceed to draw for the benefit of our readers.</p>
                <p>The natives near the cataracts or rau-<lb break="no"/>dales of the Oroonoko, up which river M.<lb break="yes"/>de Humboldt made his way to a height<lb break="yes"/>little known to Europeans, are distin-<lb break="no"/>guished by several remarkable prejudices,<lb break="yes"/>among which, none are more fatal than<lb break="yes"/>those narrated in the following:&#x2014;<lb break="yes"/>&#x201C;Among the causes of the depopulation<lb break="yes"/>of the Raudales, I have not reckoned the<lb break="yes"/>small pox; that malady which, in other<lb break="yes"/>parts of America, makes such cruel ravages,<lb break="yes"/>that the natives, seized with dismay, burn<lb break="yes" />their huts, kill their children, and renounce<lb break="yes"/>every kind of society.<note place="foot" n="*">As the Mabas in the planes of the Mis-<lb break="no"/>soury, according to the accounts of the Ame-<lb break="no" />rican travellers, Clark and Lewis.</note> This scourge is<lb break="yes" />almost unknown on the banks of the<lb break="yes"/>Oronoko. What depopulates the Chris-<lb break="no"/>tian settlements is, the repugnance of the<lb break="yes"/>Indians for the regulations of the missions,<lb break="yes" />the insalubrity of a climate at once hot and<lb break="yes"/>damp, bad nourishment, want of care in<lb break="yes"/>the diseases of children, and the guilty<lb break="yes"/>practice of mothers of preventing pregnancy<lb break="yes"/>by the use of deleterious herbs. Among<lb break="yes"/>the barbarous people of Guyana, as well as<lb break="yes"/>those of the half-civilized islands of the<cb/>South Sea, young wives will not become<lb break="yes"/>mothers. If they have children, their off-<lb break="no" />spring are exposed, not only to the dangers<lb break="yes"/>of savage life, but also to the dangers aris-<lb break="no"/>ing from the strangest popular prejudices.<lb break="yes"/>When twins are born, false notions of pro-<lb break="no"/>priety and family honour require, that one<lb break="yes"/>of them should be destroyed. &#x2018;To bring<lb break="yes"/>twins into the world, is to be exposed to<lb break="yes"/>public scorn; it is to resemble rats, opos-<lb break="no"/>sums, and the vilest animals, which bring<lb break="yes"/>forth a great number of young at a time.&#x2019;<lb break="yes" />Nay more: &#x2018;two children born at the<lb break="yes"/>same time cannot belong to the same fa-<lb break="no"/>ther.&#x2019; This is an axiom of physiology of<lb break="yes"/>the Salivas; and in every zone, and in dif-<lb break="no"/>ferent states of society, when the vulgar<lb break="yes"/>seize upon an axiom, they adhere to it<lb break="yes"/>with more stedfastness than the better<lb break="yes"/>informed men, by whom it was first ha-<lb break="no" />zarded. To avoid a disturbance of con-<lb break="no"/>jugal tranquillity, the old female relations<lb break="yes"/>of the mother, or the <hi rendition="#i" >mure japoic-nei</hi> (mid-<lb break="no"/>wives,) take care, that one of the twins<lb break="yes"/>shall disappear. If the new-born infant,<lb break="yes"/>though not a twin, have any physical de-<lb break="no" />formity, the father instantly puts it to<lb break="yes"/>death. They will have only robust and<lb break="yes"/>well-made children, for deformities indicate<lb break="yes"/>some influence of the evil spirit Ioloquiamo,<lb break="yes" />or the bird <hi rendition="#i">Tikitiki</hi>, the enemy of the hu-<lb break="no"/>man race. Sometimes children of a feeble<lb break="yes" />constitution undergo the same fate. When<lb break="yes"/>the father is asked, what is become of one<lb break="yes"/>of his sons, he will pretend, that he has<lb break="yes"/>lost him by a natural death. He will dis-<lb break="no" />avow an action, that appears to him blame-<lb break="no"/>able, but not criminal. &#x2019;The poor <hi rendition="#i">mure</hi>,<note place="foot" n="*" >In Tamanack <hi rendition="#i">mure</hi> signifies a child; <hi rendition="#i">emuru</hi>,<lb break="yes"/>a son.</note>&#x201D;<lb break="yes"/>he will tell you, &#x2019;could not follow us; we<lb break="yes"/>must have waited for him every moment;<lb break="yes"/>he has not been seen again, he did not<lb break="yes"/>come to sleep where we passed the night.&#x2019;<lb break="yes"/>Such is the candour and simplicity of man-<lb break="no"/>ners, such the boasted happiness of man<lb break="yes"/>in the <hi rendition="#i">state of nature</hi>! He kills his son,<lb break="yes" />to escape the ridicule of having twins, or<lb break="yes"/>to avoid journeying more slowly; in fact,<lb break="yes"/>to avoid a little inconvenience.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>Amid the prodigality and magnificence<lb break="yes"/>of nature, such are the moral evils which<lb break="yes"/>deform the scene; and we are often com-<lb break="no"/>pelled to leave the author&#x2019;s glowing des-<lb break="no" />criptions of superb landscape in the torrid<lb break="yes"/>zone, to vex our spirits with similar details.<lb break="yes"/>But, the able manner in which distant ob-<lb break="no"/>jects and remote similitudes are brought to<lb break="yes"/>bear on almost every subject discussed, is<lb break="yes"/>the great charm of this work; and we have<lb break="yes"/>so vast a quantity of intelligence combined<lb break="yes"/>with so rich a fund of amusing anecdote,<lb break="yes"/>that the mind never tires. It has been<cb/>alleged, that Mr. H. is too prone to this<lb break="yes"/>sort of classification, and to theories built<lb break="yes"/>upon it; but however that may be in a<lb break="yes"/>philosophical point of view, as a popular<lb break="yes"/>performance, it wonderfully enhances the<lb break="yes" />attractions of his narrative. He is, in<lb break="yes"/>truth, the very Jacques of travellers; and<lb break="yes"/>his way is delectable, &#x201C; compounded of<lb break="yes"/>many simples, extracted from many ob-<lb break="no"/>jects; and, indeed, the sundry contempla-<lb break="no"/>tion of his travels, in which his often ru-<lb break="no"/>mination wraps him in a most <choice>
                        <sic>humourous</sic>
                        <corr type="editorial">humorous</corr>
                    </choice>
                    <lb break="yes"/>sadness.&#x201D; He morals on every thing; for example:&#x2014;</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The inhabitants of Atures and May-<lb break="no"/>pures, whatever the missionaries may have<lb break="yes"/>asserted in their works, are not more struck<lb break="yes"/>with deafness by the noise of the great<lb break="yes"/>cataracts, than the catadupes of the Nile.<lb break="yes"/>When this noise is heard in the plain that<lb break="yes"/>surrounds the mission, at the distance of<lb break="yes"/>more than a league, you seem to be near<lb break="yes"/>a coast skirted by reefs and breakers. The<lb break="yes" />noise is three times as loud by night as by<lb break="yes"/>day, and gives an inexpressible charm to<lb break="yes"/>these solitary scenes. What can be the<lb break="yes"/>cause of this increased intensity of sound<lb break="yes"/>in a desert, where nothing seems to inter-<lb break="no"/>rupt the silence of nature? The velocity<lb break="yes"/>of the propagation of sound, far from aug-<lb break="no"/>menting, decreases with the lowering of the<lb break="yes" />temperature. The intensity diminishes in<lb break="yes"/>air, agitated by a wind, which is contrary<lb break="yes"/>to the direction of the sound; it diminishes<lb break="yes"/>also by dilatation of the air, and is weaker<lb break="yes"/>in the higher than in the lower regions of<lb break="yes"/>the atmosphere, where the number of par-<lb break="no"/>ticles of air in motion is greater in the<lb break="yes"/>same radius. The intensity is the same in<lb break="yes"/>dry air, and in air mingled with vapours;<lb break="yes"/>but it is feebler in carbonic acid gas, than<lb break="yes"/>in mixtures of azot and oxygen. From<lb break="yes"/>these facts, which are all we know with<lb break="yes"/>any certainty, it is difficult to explain a<lb break="yes" />phenomenon observed near every cascade<lb break="yes"/>in Europe, and which, long before our ar-<lb break="no"/>rival in the village of Atures, had struck<lb break="yes"/>the missionary and the Indians. The noc-<lb break="no"/>turnal temperature of the atmosphere is<lb break="yes"/>3° less than the temperature of the day;<lb break="yes"/>at the same time the apparent humidity<lb break="yes" />augments at night, and the mist that covers<lb break="yes"/>the cataracts becomes thicker. We have<lb break="yes"/>just seen, that the hygroscopic state of the<lb break="yes"/>air has no influence on the propagation of<lb break="yes" />the sound, and that the cooling of the air<lb break="yes"/>diminishes its swiftness.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;It may be thought, that, even in places<lb break="yes"/>not inhabited by man, the hum of insects,<lb break="yes"/>the song of birds, the rustling of leaves<lb break="yes"/>agitated by the feeblest winds, occasion,<lb break="yes"/>during the day, a confused noise, which we<lb break="yes" />perceive the less because it is uniform, and<lb break="yes"/>constantly strikes the ear. Now this noise,<lb break="yes"/>
                </p>
                <pb n="354" facs="#f0002"/>
                <p>however slightly perceptible it may be,<lb break="yes"/>may diminish the intensity of a louder,<lb break="yes"/>noise; and this diminution may cease, if<lb break="yes"/>during the calm of the night the song of<lb break="yes" />birds, the hum of insects, and the action of<lb break="yes"/>the wind upon the leaves, be interrupted.<lb break="yes"/>But this reasoning, even admitting its just-<lb break="no"/>ness, can scarcely be applied to the forests<lb break="yes"/>of the Oroonoko, where the air is con-<lb break="no"/>stantly filled by an innumerable quantity<lb break="yes"/>of moschettoes, where the hum of insects<lb break="yes"/>is much louder by night than by day, and<lb break="yes"/>where the breeze, if ever it be felt, blows<lb break="yes" />only after sunset.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;I rather think, that the presence of<lb break="yes"/>the sun acts upon the propagation and in-<lb break="no"/>tensity of the sound by the obstacles which<lb break="yes"/>they find in the currents of air different<lb break="yes"/>density, and the partial undulations of the<lb break="yes" />atmosphere caused by the unequal heating<lb break="yes"/>of different parts of the soil. In calm air,<lb break="yes"/>whether it be dry, or mingled with vesi-<lb break="no"/>cular vapours equally distributed, the <hi rendition="#i">so-<lb break="no"/>norous undulation</hi> is propagated without<lb break="yes"/>difficulty. But when the air is crossed in<lb break="yes"/>every direction by small currents of hotter<lb break="yes" />air, the sonorous undulation is divided into<lb break="yes"/>two undulations; where the density of the<lb break="yes"/>medium changes abruptly, partial echoes<lb break="yes"/>are formed, that weaken the sound, because<lb break="yes"/>one of the streams comes back upon itself;<lb break="yes"/>and those divisions of undulations take<lb break="yes"/>place, of which Mr. Poisson has recently<lb break="yes"/>developed the theory with great sagacity.<lb break="yes"/>It is not therefore the movement of the<lb break="yes" />particles of air from below to above in the<lb break="yes"/>ascending current, or the small oblique<lb break="yes"/>currents, that we consider as opposing by<lb break="yes"/>a shock the propagation of the sonorous<lb break="yes" />undulations. A shock, given to the sur-<lb break="no"/>face of a liquid, will form circles around<lb break="yes"/>the center of percussion, even then the<lb break="yes"/>liquid is agitated. Several kinds of undu-<lb break="no" />lations may cross each other in water, as in<lb break="yes"/>air, without being disturbed in their pro-<lb break="no"/>pagation; little movements may <hi rendition="#i">ride over<lb break="yes"/>each other</hi>, and the real cause of the less<lb break="yes"/>intensity of sound during the day appears<lb break="yes"/>to be the interruption of homogeneity in<lb break="yes"/>the elastic medium. During the day,<lb break="yes"/>there is a sudden interruption of density,<lb break="yes"/>where ever small streamlets of air of a high<lb break="yes"/>temperature rise over parts of the soil un-<lb break="no" />equally heated. The sonorous undulations<lb break="yes"/>are divided, as the rays of light are re-<lb break="no"/>fracted, and form the <hi rendition="#i" >mirage</hi> (looming),<lb break="yes"/>wherever strata of air of unequal density<lb break="yes"/>are contiguous. The propagation of sound<lb break="yes"/>is altered, when a stratum hydrogen gas<lb break="yes"/>is made to rise in a tube closed at one<lb break="yes"/>end above a stratum of atmospheric air;<lb break="yes"/>and Mr. Biot has well explained, by the in-<lb break="no"/>terposition of bubbles of carbonic acid gas,<lb break="yes"/>why a glass filled with Champagne wine<lb break="yes"/>is little sonorous so long as the gas is<lb break="yes"/>evolved, and continues to pass through<lb break="yes" />the strata of the liquid.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>This hypothesis is well worth further<lb break="yes"/>investigations; but we must surrender it to<lb break="yes"/>the scientific journals, and continue our<lb break="yes"/>more mixed career.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The Indians of Atures,&#x201D; says Mr. H.,<lb break="yes"/>&#x201C;are mild, moderate, and accustomed, from<lb break="yes"/>the effects of their idleness, to the greatest<cb/>privations. Formerly, excited to labour<lb break="yes"/>by the Jesuits, they did not want for food.<lb break="yes"/>The fathers cultivated maize, French beans,<lb break="yes"/>(<hi rendition="#i" >frisoles</hi>), and other European vegetables;<lb break="yes"/>they even planted sweet oranges and ta-<lb break="no"/>marinds round the villages ; and they pos-<lb break="no"/>sessed twenty or thirty thousand head of<lb break="yes" />cows and horses, in the savannahs of<lb break="yes"/>Atures and Carichana. They had at their<lb break="yes"/>service a great number of slaves and ser-<lb break="no"/>vants (<hi rendition="#i">peones</hi>), to take care of their herds.<lb break="yes"/>Nothing is now cultivated but a little cas-<lb break="no"/>sava, and a few plantains. The fertility<lb break="yes"/>of the soil however is such, that at Atures<lb break="yes"/>I counted on a single branch of musa 108<lb break="yes"/>fruits, 4 or 5 of which would almost suffice<lb break="yes"/>for the daily nourishment of a man. The<lb break="yes"/>culture of maize is entirely neglected, and<lb break="yes"/>the horses and cows have disappeared.<lb break="yes"/>Near the <hi rendition="#i" >raudal</hi>, a part of the village still<lb break="yes"/>bears the name of <hi rendition="#i">Passo del ganado</hi> (ford<lb break="yes"/>of the cattle), while the descendants of<lb break="yes"/>those very Indians, whom the Jesuits had<lb break="yes"/>assembled in a mission, speak of horned<lb break="yes"/>cattle as of animals of a race that is lost.<lb break="yes"/>In going up the Oroonoko, toward San<lb break="yes"/>Carlos del Rio Negro, we saw the last cow<lb break="yes"/>at Carichana. The fathers of the Observ-<lb break="no"/>ance, who now govern these vast countries,<lb break="yes"/>did not immediately succeed the Jesuits.<lb break="yes"/>During an interregnum of eighteen years,<lb break="yes"/>the missions were visited only from time<lb break="yes"/>to time, and by Capuchin monks. The<lb break="yes"/>agents of the secular government, under<lb break="yes"/>the title of <hi rendition="#i" >Commissioners of the King</hi>, ma-<lb break="no"/>naged the <hi rendition="#i">hatos</hi> or farms of the Jesuits<lb break="yes"/>with culpable negligence. They killed the<lb break="yes"/>cattle in order to sell the hides. Many<lb break="yes"/>heifers were devoured by tigers, and a<lb break="yes"/>greater number perished in consequence<lb break="yes"/>of wounds made by the bats of the<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">raudales</hi>, which are much less, but far<lb break="yes" />bolder than the bats of the Llanos. At<lb break="yes"/>the time of the expedition of the bounda-<lb break="no"/>ries, the horses of Encaramada, Carichana,<lb break="yes"/>and Atures, were conveyed as far as San<lb break="yes"/>Jose of Maravitanos, where, on the banks<lb break="yes"/>of the Rio Negro, the Portugueze could<lb break="yes"/>only procure them after a long passage,<lb break="yes"/>and of a very inferior quality, by the river<lb break="yes"/>Amazon and Grand Para. Since the year<lb break="yes"/>1795, the cattle of the Jesuits have entirely<lb break="yes"/>disappeared. There now remains in tes-<lb break="no"/>timony of the ancient cultivation of these<lb break="yes"/>countries, and the industrious activity of<lb break="yes"/>the first missionaries, only a few trunks of<lb break="yes"/>the orange and tamarind in the savannahs, <lb break="yes"/>surrounded by wild trees.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The tigers, or jaguars, which are less<lb break="yes"/>dangerous for the cattle than the bats,<lb break="yes"/>come into the village at Atures, and devour<lb break="yes"/>the pigs of the poor Indians. The mis-<lb break="no" />sionary related to us a striking instance of<lb break="yes"/>the familiarity of these animals, upon the<lb break="yes"/>whole so ferocious. Some months before<lb break="yes"/>our arrival, a jaguar, which was thought to<lb break="yes"/>be young, though of a large size, had<lb break="yes"/>wounded a child in playing with him; I use<lb break="yes"/> confidently this expression, which may<lb break="yes"/>seem strange, having on the spot verified<lb break="yes"/>facts which are not without interest in the<lb break="yes" />history of the manners of animals. Two<lb break="yes"/>Indian children, a boy and a girl, about<lb break="yes"/>eight and nine years of age, were seated<cb/>on the grass near the village of Atures, in<lb break="yes"/>the middle of a savannah, which we have<lb break="yes"/>often traversed. At two o&#x2019;clock in the af-<lb break="no"/>ternoon, a jaguar issued from the forest,<lb break="yes"/>and approached the children, bounding<lb break="yes" />around them; sometimes he hid himself<lb break="yes"/>in the high grass, sometimes he sprang<lb break="yes"/>forward, his back bent, his head hung<lb break="yes"/>down, in the manner of our cats. The<lb break="yes"/>little boy, ignorant of his danger, seemed<lb break="yes"/>to be sensible of it only when the jaguar<lb break="yes"/>with one of bis paws gave him some blows<lb break="yes"/>on the head. These blows, at first slight,<lb break="yes" />became ruder and ruder; the claws of the<lb break="yes"/>jaguar wounded the child, and the blood<lb break="yes"/>flowed with violence. The little girl then<lb break="yes"/>took a branch of a tree, struck the animal,<lb break="yes"/>and it fled from her. The Indians ran up<lb break="yes"/>at the cries of the children, and saw the<lb break="yes"/>jaguar, which retired bounding, without the<lb break="yes"/>least show of resistance.</p>
                <p> &#x201C;The little boy was brought to us, who<lb break="yes"/>appeared lively and intelligent. The claw<lb break="yes"/>of the jaguar had taken away the skin from<lb break="yes"/>the lower part of the forehead, and there<lb break="yes"/>was a second scar at the top of the head.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>&#x201C;Among the monkeys,&#x201D; the author<lb break="yes"/>continues, &#x201C;which we saw at the mission<lb break="yes"/>of the Atures, we found one new species<lb break="yes"/>of the tribe of <hi rendition="#i">sais</hi> and <hi rendition="#i">sajous</hi>, which the<lb break="yes"/>Creoles vulgarly call <hi rendition="#i">machis</hi>. It is the<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">ouavapavi</hi> with grey hair and a bluish face.<lb break="yes"/>It has the orbits of the eyes and forehead<lb break="yes"/>as white as snow, which at first sight dis-<lb break="no"/>tinguish it from the <hi rendition="#i">simia capucina</hi>, the<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">simia apella</hi>, the <hi rendition="#i">simia trepida</hi>, and the<lb break="yes"/>other weeping monkeys hitherto so con-<lb break="no" />fusedly described. This little animal is as<lb break="yes"/>gentle as it is ugly. Every day in the<lb break="yes"/>court-yard of the missionary it seized a pig,<lb break="yes"/>upon which it remained from morning till<lb break="yes" />night, traversing the savannahs. We have<lb break="yes"/>also seen it upon the back of a large cat,<lb break="yes"/>which bad been brought up with it in fa-<lb break="no"/>ther Zea's house.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;It was among the cataracts that we began<lb break="yes"/>to hear of the hairy man of the woods, called<lb break="yes"/>salvaje, that carries off women, constructs<lb break="yes"/>huts, and sometimes eats human flesh. The<lb break="yes"/>Tamanacks call it <hi rendition="#i">achi</hi>, and the Maypures<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">vasitri</hi>, or <hi rendition="#i">great devil</hi>. The natives and the<lb break="yes"/>missionaries have no doubt of the exist-<lb break="no"/>ence of this anthropomorphous monkey,<lb break="yes"/>which they singularly dread. Father Gili<lb break="yes"/>gravely relates the history of a lady in the<lb break="yes"/>town of San Carlos, who much praised the<lb break="yes"/>gentle character and attentions of the man<lb break="yes"/>of the woods. She lived several years with<lb break="yes"/>one in great domestic harmony, and only<lb break="yes"/>requested some hunters to take her back,<lb break="yes"/>&#x2018;because she was tired, she and her chil-<lb break="no" />dren (a little hairy also), of living far from<lb break="yes"/>the church and the sacraments.&#x201D; The<lb break="yes"/>same author, notwithstanding his credulity,<lb break="yes"/>confesses, that he had not been able to<lb break="yes"/>find an Indian, who asserted positively that<lb break="yes"/>he had seen the <hi rendition="#i">salvaje</hi> with his own eyes.<lb break="yes" />This fable, which the missionaries, the Eu-<lb break="no"/>ropean planters, and the negroes of Africa,<lb break="yes"/>have no doubt embellished with many fea-<lb break="no"/>tures taken from the description of the<lb break="yes" />manners of the ourang outang, the gibbon,<lb break="yes"/>the jocko or chimpanzee, and the pongo,<lb break="yes"/>pursued us during five years from the north-<lb break="no"/>

                <p>ern to the southern hemisphere; and we<lb break="yes"/>were every where blamed, in the most cul-<lb break="no"/>tivated class of society, for being the only<lb break="yes"/>persons to doubt the existence of the great<lb break="yes" />anthropomorphous monkey of America.<lb break="yes"/>We shall first observe, that there are cer-<lb break="no"/>tain regions, where this belief is particu-<lb break="no"/>larly prevalent among the people; such<lb break="yes"/>are the banks of the Upper Oroonoko, the<lb break="yes"/>valley of Upar near the Lake of Maracaybo,<lb break="yes"/>the mountains of Santa Martha and of Me-<lb break="no"/>rida, the provinces of Quixos, and the<lb break="yes"/>banks of the Amazon near Tomependa.<lb break="yes"/>In all these places, so distant one from the<lb break="yes"/>other, it is repeated, that the <hi rendition="#i">salvaje</hi> is<lb break="yes"/>easily recognized by the traces of its feet,<lb break="yes"/>the toes of which are turned backward.<lb break="yes"/> But if there exist a monkey of a large size<lb break="yes"/>in the New Continent, how has it hap-<lb break="no"/>pened, that during three centuries no man<lb break="yes"/> worthy of belief has been able to procure<lb break="yes"/>the skin of one? Several hypotheses pre-<lb break="no"/>sent themselves to the mind, in order to<lb break="yes"/>explain the source of so ancient an error<lb break="yes"/>or belief. Has the famous <hi rendition="#i">capuchin</hi> mon-<lb break="no"/>key of Esmeralda, the canine teeth of<lb break="yes"/>which are more than six lines and a half long,<lb break="yes"/>the physiognomy much more like man&#x2019;s<lb break="yes"/>than that of the ourang outang, and which,<lb break="yes"/> when irritated, rubs its beard with its hand,<lb break="yes"/> give rise to the fable of the <hi rendition="#i">salvaje</hi>? It<lb break="yes"/>is not so large indeed as the coaita<lb break="yes"/>(<hi rendition="#i">simia paniscus</hi>); but when seen at<lb break="yes"/>the top of a tree, and the head only<lb break="yes"/>visible, it might easily be taken for<lb break="yes"/>a human being. It may be also (and<lb break="yes"/>this opinion appears to me the most pro-<lb break="no"/>bable), that the man of the woods was one<lb break="yes" />of those large bears, the footsteps of which<lb break="yes"/>resemble those of a man, and which is be-<lb break="no"/>lieved in every country to attack women.<lb break="yes"/> The animal killed in my time at the foot of<lb break="yes"/> the mountains of Merida, and sent, by the<lb break="yes"/>name of <hi rendition="#i">salvaje</hi>, to Colonel Ungaro, the go-<lb break="no" />vernor of the province Varinas, was in fact<lb break="yes"/>a bear with black and smooth fur.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>These extraordinary accounts are suc-<lb break="no"/>ceeded by a detailed history of the Moschet-<lb break="no"/>toes of this region; perhaps the most re-<lb break="no"/>markable of all its animal phenomena.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;Persons who have not navigated the<lb break="yes"/>great rivers of equinoctial America, for in-<lb break="no"/>stance, the Oroonoko and the Rio Magda-<lb break="no"/>lena, can scarcely conceive, how without in-<lb break="no"/>terruption, at every instant of life, you may<lb break="yes"/>be tormented by insects flying in the air,<lb break="yes"/>and how the multitude of these little ani-<lb break="no"/>mals may render vast regions wholly unin-<lb break="no"/>habitable. However accustomed you may be<lb break="yes"/> to endure pain without complaint, however<lb break="yes"/> lively an interest you may take in the ob-<lb break="no"/>jects of your researches, it is impossible not<lb break="yes"/>to be constantly disturbed by the moschet-<lb break="no" />toes, <hi rendition="#i">zancudoes, jejens</hi> and <hi rendition="#i" >tempraneroes</hi>, that<lb break="yes"/>cover the face and hands, pierce the clothes<lb break="yes"/>with their long sucker in the form of a nee-<lb break="no"/>dle, and, getting into the mouth and nos-<lb break="no"/>trils, set you coughing and sneezing when-<lb break="no"/>ever you attempt to speak in the open air.<lb break="yes"/>In the missions of the Oroonoko, in the vil-<lb break="no"/>lages placed on the banks of the river, sur-<lb break="no" />rounded by immense forests, the <hi rendition="#i">plaga de<lb break="yes" />las moscas</hi>, the plague of the flies, affords an<lb break="yes" />inexhaustible subject of conversation. When<cb/>two persons meet in the morning, the first<lb break="yes"/>questions they address to each other are,<lb break="yes"/>&#x2018;How did you find the zancudoes during<lb break="yes" />the night? How are we to day for the<lb break="yes"/>moschettoes.&#x2019; These questions remind<lb break="yes"/>us of a Chinese form of politeness,<lb break="yes"/> which indicates the ancient state of the<lb break="yes" />country where it took birth. Salutations<lb break="yes"/>were made heretofore in the <hi rendition="#i">celestial<lb break="yes"/>empire</hi>, in the following <choice><sic>works</sic><corr type="editorial">words</corr></choice>, <hi rendition="#i">vou-tou-<lb break="maybe"/>hou</hi>, &#x2018;Have you been incommoded in the<lb break="yes"/>night by the serpents?<choice><sic></sic><corr type="editorial">&#x2019;</corr></choice> We shall soon see,<lb break="yes"/>that on the banks of the Tuamini, in<lb break="yes"/> the river Magdalena, and still more at<lb break="yes"/>Choco, the country of gold and platina, the<lb break="yes"/>Chinese compliment on the serpents might<lb break="yes"/>be added to that of the moschettoes.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>Other curious facts are recorded, and il-<lb break="no"/>lustrate this subject. Mr. H. says&#x2014;</p>
                <p>&#x201C;At Mandavaca we found an old mis-<lb break="no"/>sionary, who told us with an air of sadness,<lb break="yes"/>that he bad spent <hi rendition="#i">his twenty years of mos-<lb break="no"/>chettoes</hi> in America. He desired us to look<lb break="yes"/>well at his legs, that we might be able to<lb break="yes"/> tell one day, &#x2018;poor alla (beyond sea), what<lb break="yes"/>the poor monks suffer in the forests of<lb break="yes" />Cassiquiare.&#x2019; Every sting leaving a small<lb break="yes"/>darkish brown point, his legs were so<lb break="yes"/>speckled, that it was difficult to recognize<lb break="yes"/>the whiteness of his skin through the spots<lb break="yes"/>of coagulated blood. If the insects of the<lb break="yes"/> simulium genus abound in the Cassiquiare,<lb break="yes"/>which has <hi rendition="#i">white waters</hi>, the culices, or<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">zancudoes</hi>, are so much the more rare;<lb break="yes" />you scarcely find any there, while on the<lb break="yes"/>rivers of <hi rendition="#i">black waters</hi>, in the Atabapo and<lb break="yes"/>the Rio Negro, there are generally some<lb break="yes"/>

                    <lb break="yes"/>Our last number left us in the midst of a<lb break="yes"/>swarm of moschettoes, and, however pain-<lb break="no"/>ful it has been to remain a week among<lb break="yes"/>these pestiferous insects, there we are<lb break="yes"/>still. Proceeding with his anecdotes to il-<lb break="no" />lustrate their natural history, our author<lb break="yes"/>says:<lb break="yes"/>&#x201C;I have just shown, from my own obser-<lb break="no" />vations, how much the geographical distri-<lb break="no"/>bution of venomous insects varies in this la-<lb break="no"/>byrinth of rivers with white and black waters.<lb break="yes"/>It were to be wished, that a learned entomo-<lb break="no"/>logist could study on the spot the specific<lb break="yes" />differences of these noxious insects, which<lb break="yes"/>in the torrid zone, in spite of their little-<lb break="no"/>ness, act an important part in the economy<lb break="yes"/>of nature. What appeared to us very re-<lb break="no"/>markable, and is a fact, known to all the<lb break="yes" />missionaries, is, that the different species<lb break="yes"/>do not associate together, and that at dif-<lb break="no"/>ferent hours of the day you are stung by a<lb break="yes"/>distinct species. Every time that the scene<lb break="yes" />changes, and to use the simple expression<lb break="yes"/>of the missionaries, other insects &#x2018;mount<lb break="yes"/>guard<choice><sic>.</sic><corr type="editorial">,</corr></choice>&#x2019; you have a few minutes, often a<lb break="yes"/>quarter of an hour, of repose. The insects<lb break="yes"/>that disappear have not their places in-<lb break="no"/>stantly supplied in equal numbers by their<lb break="yes"/>successors. From half after six in the<lb break="yes"/>morning till five in the afternoon, the air is</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <pb n="375" facs="#f0005"/>
                <p>filled with moschettoes; which have not, as<lb break="yes"/>we find related in some travels, the form of<lb break="yes"/>our gnats, but that of a small fly. They are<lb break="yes"/>simuliums of the family nemocer&#x00E6; of the<lb break="yes"/>system of Latreille. Their sting is as pain-<lb break="no"/>ful as that of <hi rendition="#i">stomoxes</hi>. It leaves a little red-<lb break="no"/>dish-brown spot, which is extravasated and<lb break="yes" />coagulated blood, where their proboscis has<lb break="yes"/>pierced the skin. An hour before sun-set a<lb break="yes"/>species of small gnats, called <hi rendition="#i">tempraneros</hi>,<lb break="yes"/>because they appear also at sun-rise, take<lb break="yes"/>the place of the moschettoes. Their pre-<lb break="no"/>sence scarcely lasts an hour and a half;<lb break="yes"/>they disappear between six and seven in the<lb break="yes"/>evening, or, as they say here, after the <hi rendition="#i">An-<lb break="no"/>gelus</hi>(<hi rendition="#i">a la oracion</hi>). After a few minutes<lb break="yes" />repose, you feel yourself stund by <hi rendition="#i">zancudoes</hi>,<lb break="yes"/>another species of gnat (culex) with very<lb break="yes"/>long legs. The zancudo, the proboscis of<lb break="yes"/>which contains a sharp pointed sucker,<lb break="yes"/>causes the most acute pain, and a swelling<lb break="yes"/>that remains several weeks. Its hum re-<lb break="no"/>sembles that of our gnats in Europe, but is<lb break="yes"/>louder and more prolonged. The Indians<lb break="yes"/>pretend to distinguish &#x2018;by their song&#x2019; the<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">zancudoes</hi> and the <hi rendition="#i">tempraneroes</hi>; the latter<lb break="yes"/>of which are real <hi rendition="#i">twilight insects</hi>, while the<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">zancudoes</hi> are most frequently <hi rendition="#i" >nocturnal in-<lb break="no"/>sects</hi>, and disappear towards sun-rise.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The <hi rendition="#i">culices</hi> of South America, have ge-<lb break="no"/>nerally the wings, corselet, and legs of an<lb break="yes" />azure colour, annulated, and variable from<lb break="yes"/>a mixture of spots of a metallic lustre.<lb break="yes"/>Here, as in Europe, the males, which are<lb break="yes"/>distinguished by their feathered antenn&#x00E6;,<lb break="yes"/>are extremely rare; you are seldom stung<lb break="yes"/>except by females. The preponderance of<lb break="yes"/>this sex explains the immense increase of<lb break="yes"/>the species, each female laying several hun-<lb break="no"/>dred eggs. In going up one of the great<lb break="yes"/>rivers of Ameriva, it is observed, that the<lb break="yes"/>appearance of a new species of <hi rendition="#i">culex</hi> denotes<lb break="yes"/>the approximity of a new stream flowing<lb break="yes"/>in.<choice><sic>j</sic><corr type="editorial"></corr></choice>&#x2019;</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The whites born in the torrid zone walk<lb break="yes"/>barefoot with impunity in the same apart-<lb break="no"/>ment where a European recently landed is<lb break="yes"/>exposed to the attack of the <hi rendition="#i" >niguas</hi> or <hi rendition="#i">chegoes</hi>
                    <lb break="yes"/>(<hi rendition="#i">pulex penetrans</hi>). These animals, almost<lb break="yes"/>invisible to the eye, get under the nails of<lb break="yes"/>the feet, and there acquire the size of a<lb break="yes"/>small pea by the quick increase of its eggs,<lb break="yes"/>which are placed in a bag under the belly<lb break="yes"/>of the insect. The <hi rendition="#i" >nigua</hi>, therefore, distin-<lb break="no"/>guishes, what the most delicate chemical<lb break="yes"/>analysis could not distinguish, the cellular<lb break="yes"/>membrane and blood of a European from<lb break="yes"/>those of a Creole white. It is not so with<lb break="yes"/>the moschettoes.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;In the day, even when labouring at<lb break="yes"/>the oar, the natives, in order to chase the<lb break="yes"/>insects, are continually giving one another<lb break="yes"/>smart slaps with the palm of the hand.<lb break="yes"/>Rude in all their movements, they strike<lb break="yes" />themselves and their comrades mechanically<lb break="yes"/>during their sleep. The violence of their<lb break="yes"/>blows reminds us of the Persian tale of the<lb break="yes"/>bear, that tried to kill with his paw the in-<lb break="no"/>sects on the forehead of his sleeping mas-<lb break="no"/>ter. Near Maypures we saw some young In-<lb break="no"/>dians seated in a circle and rubbing cruelly<lb break="yes"/>each others backs with the bark of trees<lb break="yes"/>dried at the fire. Indian women were oc-<lb break="no"/>cupied with a degree of patience, of which<cb/>the copper-coloured race alone are capable,<lb break="yes"/>in extirpating by means of a sharp bone<lb break="yes"/>the little mass of coagulated blood, that<lb break="yes"/>forms the centre of every sting, and<lb break="yes"/>gives the skin a speckled appearance.<lb break="yes"/>One of the most barbarous nations of the<lb break="yes"/>Oroonoko, that of the Otomacs, is ac-<lb break="no"/>quainted with the use of moschetto curtains<lb break="yes"/>(<hi rendition="#i" >mosquiteros</hi>) formed of a tissue of fibres of<lb break="yes"/>the palm tree, <hi rendition="#i">murichi</hi>. We had lately seen,<lb break="yes"/>that at Higuerote, on the coast of Caraccas,<lb break="yes"/>the people of a copper colour sleep buried in<lb break="yes"/>the sand. In the villages of the Rio Mag-<lb break="no"/>dalena the Indians often invited us to<lb break="yes" />stretch ourselves with them on ox-skins,<lb break="yes"/>near the church, in the middle of the <hi rendition="#i">plaza<lb break="yes"/>grande</hi>, where they had assembled all the<lb break="yes"/>cows in the neighbourhood. The proximity<lb break="yes"/>of cattle give some repose to man. The<lb break="yes"/>Indians of the Upper Oroonoko and the<lb break="yes" />Cassiquiare, seeing that Mr. Bonpland could<lb break="yes"/>not prepare his herbal, on account of the<lb break="yes"/>continual torment of the moschettoes, in-<lb break="no"/>vited him to enter their oveus, (<hi rendition="#i" >hornitos</hi>).<lb break="yes"/>Thus they call little chambers, without<lb break="yes"/>doors or windows, into which they creep<lb break="yes" />horizontally through a very small opening.<lb break="yes"/>When they have driven away the insects<lb break="yes"/>by means of a fire of wet brush-wood,<lb break="yes"/>which emits a great deal of smoke, they<lb break="yes"/>close the opening of the oven. The ab-<lb break="no"/>sence of moschettoes is purchased clearly<lb break="yes"/>enough by the excessive heat of stagnant<lb break="yes"/>air, and the smoke of a torch of <hi rendition="#i" >copal</hi>,<lb break="yes"/>which lights the oven during your stay in<lb break="yes"/>it. Mr. Bonpland, with courage and pa-<lb break="no"/>tience well worthy of praise, dried hundreds<lb break="yes"/>of plants, shut up in these <hi rendition="#i">hornitos</hi> of the<lb break="yes"/>Indians.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;It is difficult not to smile at hearing the<lb break="yes"/>missionaries dispute on the size and vora-<lb break="no"/>city of the moschettoes at different parts of<lb break="yes"/>the same river. In the centre of a<lb break="yes"/>country ignorant of what is passing in the<lb break="yes"/>rest of the world, this is the favorite sub-<lb break="no"/>ject of conversation. &#x2018;How I pity your si-<lb break="no"/>tuation!&#x2019; said the missionary of the rau-<lb break="no"/>dales to the missionary of Cassiquiare, at<lb break="yes"/>our departure: &#x2018;you are alone, like me, in<lb break="yes"/>this country of tigers and monkeys; with<lb break="yes"/>you fish is still more rare, and the heat<lb break="yes"/>more violent; but as for my flies, (<hi rendition="#i">mia mos-<lb break="no"/>cas</hi>) I can boast, that with one of mine I<lb break="yes"/>would beat three of yours.&#x2019;</p>
                <p>&#x201C;This voracity of insects in certain spots,<lb break="yes"/>the rage with which they attack man,<lb break="yes"/>the activity of the venom varying in the<lb break="yes"/>same species, are very remarkable facts;<lb break="yes" />which find their analogy, however, in the<lb break="yes"/>classes of large animals. The crocodile of<lb break="yes"/>Angostura pursues men, while at Nueva<lb break="yes"/>Barcelona, in the Rio Neveri, you may<lb break="yes" />bathe tranquilly in the midst of the car-<lb break="no"/>nivorous reptiles. The jaguars of Maturin,<lb break="yes"/>Cumanacoa, and the isthmus of Panama,<lb break="yes"/>are cowardly in comparison to those of the<lb break="yes" />Upper Oroonoko. The Indians well know,<lb break="yes"/>that the monkey of some valleys can easily<lb break="yes"/>be tamed, while others of the same species,<lb break="yes"/>caught elsewhere, will rather die of hunger,<lb break="yes"/>than submit to slavery.<note place="foot" n="*">&#x201C;I might have added the example of the<lb break="yes"/>scorpion of Cumana, which it is very difficult to<cb/>distinguish from that of the island of Trinidad,<lb break="yes"/>Jamaica, Carthagena, and Guayaquil; yet the<lb break="yes" />former is not more to be feared than the <hi rendition="#i">scorpio<lb break="yes"/>europ&#x00E6;us</hi> (of the south of France), while the<lb break="yes"/>latter produces consequences far more alarming<lb break="yes"/>than the <hi rendition="#i">scorpio occitanus</hi> (of Spain and Bar-<lb break="no"/>bary). At Carthagena and Guayaquil, the sting<lb break="yes"/>of the scorpion (<hi rendition="#i">alacran</hi>) instantly causes the<lb break="yes"/>loss of speech. Sometimes a singular torpor of<lb break="yes"/>the tongue is observed for fifteen or sixteen<lb break="yes"/>hours.

                <p>By this time we fancy our readers are<lb break="yes"/>as well acquainted with the habits of the<lb break="yes"/>moschettoes, as if they had been bitten by<lb break="yes"/>them all over; and further knowledge being<lb break="yes" />unnecessary, we shall advance to other<lb break="yes"/>subjects.</p>
                <p>Above the cataract of Atures, at the<lb break="yes"/>mouth of the Rio Calaniapo, Mr. Humboldt<lb break="yes"/>gives the following account of an extinct<lb break="yes"/>tribe:</p>
                <p>&#x201C;We were shown at a distance, on the<lb break="yes"/>right of the river, the rocks that surround the<lb break="yes"/>cavern of Ataruipe; but we had not time to<lb break="yes"/>visit the cemetry of the destroyed tribe of<lb break="yes"/>the Atures. We regretted this so much the<lb break="yes"/>more, as father Zea was never weary of<lb break="yes"/>talking to us of the skeletons painted with<lb break="yes"/>anotta, which this cavern contained; of<lb break="yes"/>the large vases of baked earth, in which the<lb break="yes" />bones of separate families appeared to be<lb break="yes"/>collected; and of many other curious ob-<lb break="no"/>jects, which we proposed to examine at our<lb break="yes"/>return from the Rio Negro.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>At Maypure, higher up, we hear more of<lb break="yes"/>the pottery of the Indians:</p>
                <p>&#x201C;In every part of the forests, far from<lb break="yes"/>any human habitation, on digging the earth,<lb break="yes"/>fragments of pottery and delft are found.<lb break="yes"/>The taste for this kind of fabrication seems<lb break="yes"/>to have been common heretofore to the na-<lb break="no"/>tives of both Americas. To the north of<lb break="yes"/>Mexico,&#x2014;on the banks of the Rio Gala&#x2014;<lb break="yes"/>among the ruins of an Azteck city&#x2014;in the<lb break="yes"/>United States&#x2014;near the <hi rendition="#i" >tumuli</hi> of the Mia-<lb break="no"/>mis; in Florida&#x2014;and in every place where<lb break="yes"/>any trace of ancient civilization could be<lb break="yes"/>found, the soil covers fragments of painted<lb break="yes" />pottery; and the extreme resemblances of<lb break="yes"/>the ornaments they display is striking.<lb break="yes"/>Savage nations, and those civilized people,<lb break="yes"/>who are condemned by their political<lb break="yes" />and religious institutions always to imi-<lb break="no"/>tate themselves, strive, as if by instinct, to<lb break="yes"/>perpetuate the same forms, to preserve a<lb break="yes"/>peculiar type or style, and to follow the<lb break="yes"/>methods and processes which were employed<lb break="yes"/>by their ancestors. In North America,<lb break="yes"/>fragments of delft have been discovered in<lb break="yes"/>places where lines of fortification are found,<lb break="yes"/>and the walls of towns constructed by an<lb break="yes" />unknown nation, now entirely extinct.<lb break="yes"/>The paintings on these fragments have a<lb break="yes"/>great similitude to those which are executed<lb break="yes"/>in our days on earthenware by the natives<lb break="yes"/>of Louisiana and Florida. Thus too the<lb break="yes"/>Indians of Maypure often painted before<lb break="yes"/>our eyes the same ornaments as we had<lb break="yes"/>observed in the cavern of <choice><sic>Ataroipe</sic><corr type="editorial">Ataruipe</corr></choice>, on the<lb break="yes" />vases containing human bones. They are<lb break="yes"/>real <hi rendition="#i" >grecques</hi>, <choice><sic>ineaudrites</sic><corr type="editorial">meandrites</corr></choice>, and figures of<lb break="yes"/>crocodiles, of monkeys, and of a large qua-</p>

                <p>druped, which I could not recognize, though<lb break="yes"/>it has always the same squat form.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>Above Maypure this is indeed a &#x201C;New<lb break="yes"/>World,&#x201D;: Mr. Humboldt says:&#x2014;</p>
                <p>&#x201C;When the traveller has passed the<lb break="yes"/>great cataracts, he feels as if he were in a<lb break="yes"/>new world; and had overstepped the bar-<lb break="no"/>riers which nature seems to have raised be-<lb break="no" />tween the civilized countries of the coast and<lb break="yes"/>the savage and unknown interior. Toward<lb break="yes"/>the east, in the bluish distance, appeared<lb break="yes"/>for the last time, the high chain of the Cu-<lb break="no"/>navami mountains. Its long horizontal ridge<lb break="yes" />reminded us of the Mesa of Bergantin, near<lb break="yes"/>Cumana; but it terminates by a truncated<lb break="yes"/>summit. The peak of Calitamini (the name<lb break="yes"/>given to this summit) glows at sun-set as<lb break="yes"/>with reddish fire. This appearance is<lb break="yes"/>every day the same. No one ever ap-<lb break="no"/>proached the summit of this mountain, the<lb break="yes"/>height of which does not exceed six hun-<lb break="no" />dred toises. I believe this splendor, com-<lb break="no"/>monly reddish and sometimes silvery, to be<lb break="yes"/>a reflexion produced by large plates of talc,<lb break="yes"/>or by gneiss passing into mica-slate. The<lb break="yes"/>whole of this country contains granitic<lb break="yes"/>rocks, on which here and there, in little<lb break="yes"/>plains, an argillaceous grit-stone immediately<lb break="yes"/>reposes, containing fragments of quartz,<lb break="yes"/>and of brown iron ore.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;In going to the <hi rendition="#i">embarcadere</hi>&#x201D; he con-<lb break="no"/>tinues, &#x201C;we caught on the trunk of a hevea<choice><sic></sic><corr type="editorial">,</corr></choice><lb break="yes" />a new species of tree frog, remarkable for<lb break="yes"/>its beautiful colours; it had a yellow belly,<lb break="yes"/>the back and head of a fine velvetty purple,<lb break="yes"/>and a very narrow stripe of white from the<lb break="yes"/>point of the nose to the hinder extremities.<lb break="yes" />This frog was two inches long, and allied to<lb break="yes"/>the <hi rendition="#i">rana tinctoria</hi>, the blood of which, it is<lb break="yes" />asserted, introduced into the skin of a<lb break="yes"/>parrot, in places where the feathers have<lb break="yes"/>been plucked out, occasions the growth of<lb break="yes"/>frizzled feathers of a yellow or red colour.</p>
                <p>But this is not only the region of real<lb break="yes"/>wonders; it has its fictions also.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The forests of Sipapo are altogether un-<lb break="no"/>known, and there the missionaries place<lb break="yes"/>the nation of <hi rendition="#i" >Rayas</hi>, who have their mouth<lb break="yes"/>in the navel. An old Indian, whom we<lb break="yes"/>met at Carichano, and who boasted of<lb break="yes"/>having often eaten human flesh, had seen<lb break="yes"/>these <hi rendition="#i">acephali</hi> &#x2018;with his own eyes.&#x2019; These<lb break="yes"/>absurd fables are spread as far as the Llanos,<lb break="yes" />where you are not always permitted to doubt<lb break="yes"/>the existence of the <hi rendition="#i">Raya</hi> Indians. In<lb break="yes"/>every zone intolerance accompanies cre-<lb break="no"/>dulity; and it might be said, that the fic-<lb break="no"/>tions of ancient geographers had passed from<lb break="yes"/>one hemisphere to the other, did we not<lb break="yes"/>know, that the most fantastic productions of<lb break="yes"/>the imagination, like the works of nature,<lb break="yes"/>furnish every where a certain analogy of<lb break="yes"/>aspect and form.&#x201D;</p>
