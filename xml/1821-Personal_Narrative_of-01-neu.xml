                    />Oronoko. What depopulates the Chris-<lb break="no"/>tian settlements is, the
                    repugnance of the<lb break="yes"/>Indians for the regulations of the
                        missions,<lb break="yes"/>the insalubrity of a climate at once hot and<lb
                        break="yes"/>damp, bad nourishment, want of care in<lb break="yes"/>the
                    diseases of children, and the guilty<lb break="yes"/>practice of mothers of
                    preventing pregnancy<lb break="yes"/>by the use of deleterious herbs. Among<lb
                        break="yes"/>the barbarous people of Guyana, as well as<lb break="yes"
                    />those of the half-civilized islands of the<lb break="yes"/><cb/>South Sea,
                    young wives will not become<lb break="yes"/>mothers. If they have children,
                    their off-<lb break="no"/>spring are exposed, not only to the dangers<lb
                        break="yes"/>of savage life, but also to the dangers aris-<lb break="no"
                    />ing from the strangest popular prejudices.<lb break="yes"/>When twins are
                    born, false notions of pro-<lb break="no"/>priety and family honour require,
                    that one<lb break="yes"/>of them should be destroyed. &#x2018;To bring<lb
                        break="yes"/>twins into the world, is to be exposed to<lb break="yes"
                    />public scorn; it is to resemble rats, opos-<lb break="no"/>sums, and the
                    vilest animals, which bring<lb break="yes"/>forth a great number of young at a
                        time.&#x2019;<lb break="yes"/>Nay more: &#x2018;two children born at the<lb
                        break="yes"/>same time cannot belong to the same fa-<lb break="no"
                    />ther.&#x2019; This is an axiom of physiology of<lb break="yes"/>the Salivas;
                    and in every zone, and in dif-<lb break="no"/>ferent states of society, when the
                        vulgar<lb break="yes"/>seize upon an axiom, they adhere to it<lb break="yes"
                    />with more stedfastness than the better<lb break="yes"/>informed men, by whom
                    it was first ha-<lb break="no"/>zarded. To avoid a disturbance of con-<lb
                        break="no"/>jugal tranquillity, the old female relations<lb break="yes"/>of
                    the mother, or the <hi rendition="#i">mure japoic-nei</hi> (mid-<lb break="no"
                    />wives,) take care, that one of the twins<lb break="yes"/>shall disappear. If
                    the new-born infant,<lb break="yes"/>though not a twin, have any physical de-<lb
                        break="no"/>formity, the father instantly puts it to<lb break="yes"/>death.
                    They will have only robust and<lb break="yes"/>well-made children, for
                    deformities indicate<lb break="yes"/>some influence of the evil spirit

                    the enemy of the hu-<lb break="no"/>man race. Sometimes children of a feeble<lb

                    father is asked, what is become of one<lb break="yes"/>of his sons, he will
                    pretend, that he has<lb break="yes"/>lost him by a natural death. He will

                <p>Amid the prodigality and magnificence<lb break="yes"/>of nature, such are the
                    moral evils which<lb break="yes"/>deform the scene; and we are often com-<lb
                        break="no"/>pelled to leave the author&#x2019;s glowing des-<lb break="no"
                    />criptions of superb landscape in the torrid<lb break="yes"/>zone, to vex our
                    spirits with similar details.<lb break="yes"/>But, the able manner in which
                    distant ob-<lb break="no"/>jects and remote similitudes are brought to<lb
                        break="yes"/>bear on almost every subject discussed, is<lb break="yes"/>the
                    great charm of this work; and we have<lb break="yes"/>so vast a quantity of
                    intelligence combined<lb break="yes"/>with so rich a fund of amusing
                        anecdote,<lb break="yes"/>that the mind never tires. It has been<lb
                        break="yes"/><cb/>alleged, that Mr. H. is too prone to this<lb break="yes"
                    />sort of classification, and to theories built<lb break="yes"/>upon it; but
                    however that may be in a<lb break="yes"/>philosophical point of view, as a
                        popular<lb break="yes"/>performance, it wonderfully enhances the<lb
                        break="yes"/>attractions of his narrative. He is, in<lb break="yes"/>truth,
                    the very Jacques of travellers; and<lb break="yes"/>his way is delectable,
                    &#x201C; compounded of<lb break="yes"/>many simples, extracted from many ob-<lb
                        break="no"/>jects; and, indeed, the sundry contempla-<lb break="no"/>tion of
                    his travels, in which his often ru-<lb break="no"/>mination wraps him in a most
                        humourous<lb break="yes"/>sadness.&#x201D; He morals on every thing;
                    for<lb break="yes"/>example:&#x2014;</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The inhabitants of Atures and May-<lb break="no"/>pures, whatever the
                    missionaries may have<lb break="yes"/>asserted in their works, are not more
                        struck<lb break="yes"/>with deafness by the noise of the great<lb
                        break="yes"/>cataracts, than the catadupes of the Nile.<lb break="yes"/>When
                    this noise is heard in the plain that<lb break="yes"/>surrounds the mission, at
                    the distance of<lb break="yes"/>more than a league, you seem to be near<lb
                        break="yes"/>a coast skirted by reefs and breakers. The<lb break="yes"
                    />noise is three times as loud by night as by<lb break="yes"/>day, and gives an
                    inexpressible charm to<lb break="yes"/>these solitary scenes. What can be the<lb
                        break="yes"/>cause of this increased intensity of sound<lb break="yes"/>in a
                    desert, where nothing seems to inter-<lb break="no"/>rupt the silence of nature?
                    The velocity<lb break="yes"/>of the propagation of sound, far from aug-<lb
                        break="no"/>menting, decreases with the lowering of the<lb break="yes"
                    />temperature. The intensity diminishes in<lb break="yes"/>air, agitated by a
                    wind, which is contrary<lb break="yes"/>to the direction of the sound; it
                        diminishes<lb break="yes"/>also by dilatation of the air, and is weaker<lb
                        break="yes"/>in the higher than in the lower regions of<lb break="yes"/>the
                    atmosphere, where the number of par-<lb break="no"/>ticles of air in motion is
                    greater in the<lb break="yes"/>same radius. The intensity is the same in<lb
                        break="yes"/>dry air, and in air mingled with vapours;<lb break="yes"/>but
                    it is feebler in carbonic acid gas, than<lb break="yes"/>in mixtures of azot and
                    oxygen. From<lb break="yes"/>these facts, which are all we know with<lb
                        break="yes"/>any certainty, it is difficult to explain a<lb break="yes"
                    />phenomenon observed near every cascade<lb break="yes"/>in Europe, and which,
                    long before our ar-<lb break="no"/>rival in the village of Atures, had struck<lb
                        break="yes"/>the missionary and the Indians. The noc-<lb break="no"/>turnal
                    temperature of the atmosphere is<lb break="yes"/>3° less than the temperature of
                    the day;<lb break="yes"/>at the same time the apparent humidity<lb break="yes"
                    />augments at night, and the mist that covers<lb break="yes"/>the cataracts
                    becomes thicker. We have<lb break="yes"/>just seen, that the hygroscopic state
                    of the<lb break="yes"/>air has no influence on the propagation of<lb break="yes"
                    />the sound, and that the cooling of the air<lb break="yes"/>diminishes its
                    swiftness.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;It may be thought, that, even in places<lb break="yes"/>not inhabited by
                    man, the hum of insects,<lb break="yes"/>the song of birds, the rustling of
                        leaves<lb break="yes"/>agitated by the feeblest winds, occasion,<lb
                        break="yes"/>during the day, a confused noise, which we<lb break="yes"
                    />perceive the less because it is uniform, and<lb break="yes"/>constantly
                    strikes the ear. Now this noise,<lb break="yes"/>
                </p>
                <pb n="354" facs="#f0002"/>
                <p>however slightly perceptible it may be,<lb break="yes"/>may diminish the
                    intensity of a louder,<lb break="yes"/>noise; and this diminution may cease,
                        if<lb break="yes"/>during the calm of the night the song of<lb break="yes"
                    />birds, the hum of insects, and the action of<lb break="yes"/>the wind upon the
                    leaves, be interrupted.<lb break="yes"/>But this reasoning, even admitting its
                        just-<lb break="no"/>ness, can scarcely be applied to the forests<lb
                        break="yes"/>of the Oroonoko, where the air is con-<lb break="no"/>stantly
                    filled by an innumerable quantity<lb break="yes"/>of moschettoes, where the hum
                    of insects<lb break="yes"/>is much louder by night than by day, and<lb
                        break="yes"/>where the breeze, if ever it be felt, blows<lb break="yes"
                    />only after sunset.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;I rather think, that the presence of<lb break="yes"/>the sun acts upon
                    the propagation and in-<lb break="no"/>tensity of the sound by the obstacles
                        which<lb break="yes"/>they find in the currents of air different<lb
                        break="yes"/>density, and the partial undulations of the<lb break="yes"
                    />atmosphere caused by the unequal heating<lb break="yes"/>of different parts of
                    the soil. In calm air,<lb break="yes"/>whether it be dry, or mingled with
                        vesi-<lb break="no"/>cular vapours equally distributed, the <hi
                        rendition="#i">so-<lb break="no"/>norous undulation</hi> is propagated
                        without<lb break="yes"/>difficulty. But when the air is crossed in<lb
                        break="yes"/>every direction by small currents of hotter<lb break="yes"
                    />air, the sonorous undulation is divided into<lb break="yes"/>two undulations;
                    where the density of the<lb break="yes"/>medium changes abruptly, partial
                        echoes<lb break="yes"/>are formed, that weaken the sound, because<lb
                        break="yes"/>one of the streams comes back upon itself;<lb break="yes"/>and
                    those divisions of undulations take<lb break="yes"/>place, of which Mr. Poisson
                    has recently<lb break="yes"/>developed the theory with great sagacity.<lb
                        break="yes"/>It is not therefore the movement of the<lb break="yes"
                    />particles of air from below to above in the<lb break="yes"/>ascending current,
                    or the small oblique<lb break="yes"/>currents, that we consider as opposing
                        by<lb break="yes"/>a shock the propagation of the sonorous<lb break="yes"
                    />undulations. A shock, given to the sur-<lb break="no"/>face of a liquid, will
                    form circles around<lb break="yes"/>the center of percussion, even then the<lb
                        break="yes"/>liquid is agitated. Several kinds of undu-<lb break="no"
                    />lations may cross each other in water, as in<lb break="yes"/>air, without
                    being disturbed in their pro-<lb break="no"/>pagation; little movements may <hi
                        rendition="#i">ride over<lb break="yes"/>each other</hi>, and the real cause
                    of the less<lb break="yes"/>intensity of sound during the day appears<lb
                        break="yes"/>to be the interruption of homogeneity in<lb break="yes"/>the
                    elastic medium. During the day,<lb break="yes"/>there is a sudden interruption
                    of density,<lb break="yes"/>where ever small streamlets of air of a high<lb
                        break="yes"/>temperature rise over parts of the soil un-<lb break="no"
                    />equally heated. The sonorous undulations<lb break="yes"/>are divided, as the
                    rays of light are re-<lb break="no"/>fracted, and form the <hi rendition="#i"
                        >mirage</hi> (looming),<lb break="yes"/>wherever strata of air of unequal
                        density<lb break="yes"/>are contiguous. The propagation of sound<lb
                        break="yes"/>is altered, when a stratum hydrogen gas<lb break="yes"/>is made
                    to rise in a tube closed at one<lb break="yes"/>end above a stratum of
                    atmospheric air;<lb break="yes"/>and Mr. Biot has well explained, by the in-<lb
                        break="no"/>terposition of bubbles of carbonic acid gas,<lb break="yes"/>why
                    a glass filled with Champagne wine<lb break="yes"/>is little sonorous so long as
                    the gas is<lb break="yes"/>evolved, and continues to pass through<lb break="yes"
                    />the strata of the liquid.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>This hypothesis is well worth further<lb break="yes"/>investigations; but we must
                    surrender it to<lb break="yes"/>the scientific journals, and continue our<lb
                        break="yes"/>more mixed career.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The Indians of Atures,&#x201D; says Mr. H.,<lb break="yes"/>&#x201C;are
                    mild, moderate, and accustomed, from<lb break="yes"/>the effects of their
                    idleness, to the greatest<lb break="yes"/><cb/>privations. Formerly, excited to
                        labour<lb break="yes"/>by the Jesuits, they did not want for food.<lb
                        break="yes"/>The fathers cultivated maize, French beans,<lb break="yes"
                        />(<hi rendition="#i">frisoles</hi>), and other European vegetables;<lb
                        break="yes"/>they even planted sweet oranges and ta-<lb break="no"/>marinds
                    round the villages ; and they pos-<lb break="no"/>sessed twenty or thirty
                    thousand head of<lb break="yes"/>cows and horses, in the savannahs of<lb
                        break="yes"/>Atures and Carichana. They had at their<lb break="yes"/>service
                    a great number of slaves and ser-<lb break="no"/>vants (<hi rendition="#i"
                        >peones</hi>), to take care of their herds.<lb break="yes"/>Nothing is now
                    cultivated but a little cas-<lb break="no"/>sava, and a few plantains. The
                        fertility<lb break="yes"/>of the soil however is such, that at Atures<lb
                        break="yes"/>I counted on a single branch of musa 108<lb break="yes"
                    />fruits, 4 or 5 of which would almost suffice<lb break="yes"/>for the daily
                    nourishment of a man. The<lb break="yes"/>culture of maize is entirely
                    neglected, and<lb break="yes"/>the horses and cows have disappeared.<lb
                        break="yes"/>Near the <hi rendition="#i">raudal</hi>, a part of the village
                        still<lb break="yes"/>bears the name of <hi rendition="#i">Passo del
                        ganado</hi> (ford<lb break="yes"/>of the cattle), while the descendants
                        of<lb break="yes"/>those very Indians, whom the Jesuits had<lb break="yes"
                    />assembled in a mission, speak of horned<lb break="yes"/>cattle as of animals
                    of a race that is lost.<lb break="yes"/>In going up the Oroonoko, toward San<lb
                        break="yes"/>Carlos del Rio Negro, we saw the last cow<lb break="yes"/>at
                    Carichana. The fathers of the Observ-<lb break="no"/>ance, who now govern these
                    vast countries,<lb break="yes"/>did not immediately succeed the Jesuits.<lb
                        break="yes"/>During an interregnum of eighteen years,<lb break="yes"/>the
                    missions were visited only from time<lb break="yes"/>to time, and by Capuchin
                    monks. The<lb break="yes"/>agents of the secular government, under<lb
                        break="yes"/>the title of <hi rendition="#i">Commissioners of the King</hi>,
                        ma-<lb break="no"/>naged the <hi rendition="#i">hatos</hi> or farms of the
                        Jesuits<lb break="yes"/>with culpable negligence. They killed the<lb
                        break="yes"/>cattle in order to sell the hides. Many<lb break="yes"/>heifers
                    were devoured by tigers, and a<lb break="yes"/>greater number perished in
                        consequence<lb break="yes"/>of wounds made by the bats of the<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">raudales</hi>, which are much less, but far<lb break="yes"
                    />bolder than the bats of the Llanos. At<lb break="yes"/>the time of the
                    expedition of the bounda-<lb break="no"/>ries, the horses of Encaramada,
                        Carichana,<lb break="yes"/>and Atures, were conveyed as far as San<lb
                        break="yes"/>Jose of Maravitanos, where, on the banks<lb break="yes"/>of the
                    Rio Negro, the Portugueze could<lb break="yes"/>only procure them after a long
                        passage,<lb break="yes"/>and of a very inferior quality, by the river<lb
                        break="yes"/>Amazon and Grand Para. Since the year<lb break="yes"/>1795, the
                    cattle of the Jesuits have entirely<lb break="yes"/>disappeared. There now
                    remains in tes-<lb break="no"/>timony of the ancient cultivation of these<lb
                        break="yes"/>countries, and the industrious activity of<lb break="yes"/>the
                    first missionaries, only a few trunks of<lb break="yes"/>the orange and tamarind
                    in the savannahs, <lb break="yes"/>surrounded by wild trees.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The tigers, or jaguars, which are less<lb break="yes"/>dangerous for the
                    cattle than the bats,<lb break="yes"/>come into the village at Atures, and
                        devour<lb break="yes"/>the pigs of the poor Indians. The mis-<lb break="no"
                    />sionary related to us a striking instance of<lb break="yes"/>the familiarity
                    of these animals, upon the<lb break="yes"/>whole so ferocious. Some months
                        before<lb break="yes"/>our arrival, a jaguar, which was thought to<lb
                        break="yes"/>be young, though of a large size, had<lb break="yes"/>wounded a
                    child in playing with him; I use<lb break="yes"/> confidently this expression,
                    which may<lb break="yes"/>seem strange, having on the spot verified<lb
                        break="yes"/>facts which are not without interest in the<lb break="yes"
                    />history of the manners of animals. Two<lb break="yes"/>Indian children, a boy
                    and a girl, about<lb break="yes"/>eight and nine years of age, were seated<lb
                        break="yes"/><cb/>on the grass near the village of Atures, in<lb break="yes"
                    />the middle of a savannah, which we have<lb break="yes"/>often traversed. At
                    two o&#x2019;clock in the af-<lb break="no"/>ternoon, a jaguar issued from the
                        forest,<lb break="yes"/>and approached the children, bounding<lb break="yes"

                    sometimes he sprang<lb break="yes"/>forward, his back bent, his head hung<lb
                        break="yes"/>down, in the manner of our cats. The<lb break="yes"/>little
                    boy, ignorant of his danger, seemed<lb break="yes"/>to be sensible of it only
                    when the jaguar<lb break="yes"/>with one of bis paws gave him some blows<lb
                        break="yes"/>on the head. These blows, at first slight,<lb break="yes"
                    />became ruder and ruder; the claws of the<lb break="yes"/>jaguar wounded the
                    child, and the blood<lb break="yes"/>flowed with violence. The little girl
                        then<lb break="yes"/>took a branch of a tree, struck the animal,<lb
                        break="yes"/>and it fled from her. The Indians ran up<lb break="yes"/>at the
                    cries of the children, and saw the<lb break="yes"/>jaguar, which retired
                    bounding, without the<lb break="yes"/>least show of resistance.</p>
                <p> &#x201C;The little boy was brought to us, who<lb break="yes"/>appeared lively
                    and intelligent. The claw<lb break="yes"/>of the jaguar had taken away the skin
                        from<lb break="yes"/>the lower part of the forehead, and there<lb
                        break="yes"/>was a second scar at the top of the head.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>&#x201C;Among the monkeys,&#x201D; the author<lb break="yes"/>continues,
                    &#x201C;which we saw at the mission<lb break="yes"/>of the Atures, we found one
                    new species<lb break="yes"/>of the tribe of <hi rendition="#i">sais</hi> and <hi
                        rendition="#i">sajous</hi>, which the<lb break="yes"/>Creoles vulgarly call
                        <hi rendition="#i">machis</hi>. It is the<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">ouavapavi</hi> with grey hair and a bluish face.<lb
                        break="yes"/>It has the orbits of the eyes and forehead<lb break="yes"/>as
                    white as snow, which at first sight dis-<lb break="no"/>tinguish it from the <hi

                    />fusedly described. This little animal is as<lb break="yes"/>gentle as it is
                    ugly. Every day in the<lb break="yes"/>court-yard of the missionary it seized a
                        pig,<lb break="yes"/>upon which it remained from morning till<lb break="yes"
                    />night, traversing the savannahs. We have<lb break="yes"/>also seen it upon the
                    back of a large cat,<lb break="yes"/>which bad been brought up with it in fa-<lb
                        break="no"/>ther Zea's house.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;It was among the cataracts that we began<lb break="yes"/>to hear of the
                    hairy man of the woods, called<lb break="yes"/>salvaje, that carries off women,
                        constructs<lb break="yes"/>huts, and sometimes eats human flesh. The<lb
                        break="yes"/>Tamanacks call it <hi rendition="#i">achi</hi>, and the
                        Maypures<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">vasitri</hi>, or <hi rendition="#i">great devil</hi>. The
                    natives and the<lb break="yes"/>missionaries have no doubt of the exist-<lb
                        break="no"/>ence of this anthropomorphous monkey,<lb break="yes"/>which they
                    singularly dread. Father Gili<lb break="yes"/>gravely relates the history of a
                    lady in the<lb break="yes"/>town of San Carlos, who much praised the<lb
                        break="yes"/>gentle character and attentions of the man<lb break="yes"/>of
                    the woods. She lived several years with<lb break="yes"/>one in great domestic
                    harmony, and only<lb break="yes"/>requested some hunters to take her back,<lb
                        break="yes"/>&#x2018;because she was tired, she and her chil-<lb break="no"
                    />dren (a little hairy also), of living far from<lb break="yes"/>the church and
                    the sacraments.&#x201D; The<lb break="yes"/>same author, notwithstanding his
                        credulity,<lb break="yes"/>confesses, that he had not been able to<lb
                        break="yes"/>find an Indian, who asserted positively that<lb break="yes"/>he
                    had seen the <hi rendition="#i">salvaje</hi> with his own eyes.<lb break="yes"
                    />This fable, which the missionaries, the Eu-<lb break="no"/>ropean planters,
                    and the negroes of Africa,<lb break="yes"/>have no doubt embellished with many
                        fea-<lb break="no"/>tures taken from the description of the<lb break="yes"

                    that there are cer-<lb break="no"/>tain regions, where this belief is
                        particu-<lb break="no"/>larly prevalent among the people; such<lb
                        break="yes"/>are the banks of the Upper Oroonoko, the<lb break="yes"/>valley
                    of Upar near the Lake of Maracaybo,<lb break="yes"/>the mountains of Santa

                    these places, so distant one from the<lb break="yes"/>other, it is repeated,
                    that the <hi rendition="#i">salvaje</hi> is<lb break="yes"/>easily recognized by
                    the traces of its feet,<lb break="yes"/>the toes of which are turned
                        backward.<lb break="yes"/> But if there exist a monkey of a large size<lb
                        break="yes"/>in the New Continent, how has it hap-<lb break="no"/>pened,
                    that during three centuries no man<lb break="yes"/> worthy of belief has been
                    able to procure<lb break="yes"/>the skin of one? Several hypotheses pre-<lb
                        break="no"/>sent themselves to the mind, in order to<lb break="yes"/>explain
                    the source of so ancient an error<lb break="yes"/>or belief. Has the famous <hi

                    but when seen at<lb break="yes"/>the top of a tree, and the head only<lb

                    being. It may be also (and<lb break="yes"/>this opinion appears to me the most
                        pro-<lb break="no"/>bable), that the man of the woods was one<lb break="yes"

                    disappear between six and seven in the<lb break="yes"/>evening; or, as they say

                    that of our gnats in Europe, but is<lb break="yes"/>louder and more prolonged.

                    <lb break="yes"/>(<hi rendition="#i">pulex penetrans</hi>). These animals,

                <p>&#x201C;In the day, even when labouring at<lb break="yes"/>the oar, the natives,
                    in order to chase the<lb break="yes"/>insects, are continually giving one

                    The violence of their<lb break="yes"/>blows reminds us of the Persian tale of

                    often invited us to<lb break="yes"/>stretch ourselves with them on ox-skins,<lb

                    as father Zea was never weary of<lb break="yes"/>talking to us of the skeletons
                    painted with<lb break="yes"/>anotta, which this cavern contained; of<lb

                        break="no"/>tween the civilized countries of the coast and<lb break="yes"
                    />the savage and unknown interior. Toward<lb break="yes"/>the east, in the
                    bluish distance, appeared<lb break="yes"/>for the last time, the high chain of
                    the Cu-<lb break="no"/>navami mountains. Its long horizontal ridge<lb
                        break="yes"/>reminded us of the Mesa of Bergantin, near<lb break="yes"
                    />Cumana; but it terminates by a truncated<lb break="yes"/>summit. The peak of
                    Calitamini (the name<lb break="yes"/>given to this summit) glows at sun-set
                        as<lb break="yes"/>with a reddish fire. This appearance is<lb break="yes"
                    />every day the same. No one ever ap-<lb break="no"/>proached the summit of this
                    mountain, the<lb break="yes"/>height of which does not exceed six hun-<lb
                        break="no"/>dred toises. I believe this splendor, com-<lb break="no"/>monly
                    reddish and sometimes silvery, to be<lb break="yes"/>a reflexion produced by
                    large plates of talc,<lb break="yes"/>or by gneiss passing into mica-slate.
                        The<lb break="yes"/>whole of this country contains granitic<lb break="yes"
                    />rocks, on which here and there, in little<lb break="yes"/>plains, an
                    argillaceous grit-stone immediately<lb break="yes"/>reposes, containing
                    fragments of quartz,<lb break="yes"/>and of brown iron ore.</p>

                        break="yes"/>a new species of tree frog, remarkable for<lb break="yes"/>its
                    beautiful colours; it had a yellow belly,<lb break="yes"/>the back and head of a
                    fine velvetty purple,<lb break="yes"/>and a very narrow stripe of white from
                        the<lb break="yes"/>point of the nose to the hinder extremities.<lb
                        break="yes"/>This frog was two inches long, and allied to<lb break="yes"
                    />the <hi rendition="#i">rana tinctoria</hi>, the blood of which, it is<lb
                        break="yes"/>asserted, introduced into the skin of a<lb break="yes"/>parrot,
                    in places where the feathers have<lb break="yes"/>been plucked out, occasions
                    the growth of<lb break="yes"/>frizzled feathers of a yellow or red colour.</p>
                <p>But this is not only the region of real<lb break="yes"/>wonders; it has its

                        >Rayas</hi>, who have their mouth<lb break="yes"/>in the navel. An old
                    Indian, whom we<lb break="yes"/>met at Carichano, and who boasted of<lb
                        break="yes"/>having often eaten human flesh, had seen<lb break="yes"/>these
                        <hi rendition="#i">acephali</hi> &#x2018;with his own eyes.&#x2019; These<lb

                        enterprising<lb break="yes"/>and intelligent traveller. In a preceding<lb break="yes"/>paper
                        we have remarked upon the extraor-<lb break="no"/>dinary degree of general
                        knowledge which<lb break="yes"/>he brings to bear on any topic he is
                        illus-<lb break="no"/>trating. The following is an admirable<lb break="yes"/>example of the
                        truth of this position:<lb break="yes"/></p><p>&#x201C;Every hemisphere produces plants
                            of<lb break="yes"/>a different species; and it is not by the<lb break="yes"/>diversity of climates that we can
                            attempt<lb break="yes"/>to explain why equinoctial Africa has no<lb break="yes"/>laurine&#x00E6;, and the New World no
                            heaths;<lb break="yes"/>why the calceolari&#x00E6; are found only in the<lb break="yes"/>southern hemisphere; why the
                            birds of<lb break="yes"/>the continent of India glow with colours<lb break="yes"/>less splendid than the birds
                            of the hot parts<lb break="yes"/>of America; finally, why the tiger is pecu-<lb break="no"/>liar to Asia, and the

                            the investigation of the origin<lb break="yes"/>of beings, but of the laws according to<lb break="yes"/>which
                            they are distributed on the globe.<lb break="yes"/>It examines the things that are, the
                            co-<lb break="no"/>existence of vegetable and animal forms in<lb break="yes"/>each latitude, at different

                            since they touch the<lb break="yes"/><cb/>origin, the first existence of a germe of<lb break="yes"/>life. We may add,
                            that the attempts which<lb break="yes"/>have been made, to explain the distribution<lb break="yes"/>of various
                            species on the globe by the sole<lb break="yes"/>influence of climate, date at a period when<lb break="yes"/>physical geography was still in its infancy;<lb break="yes"/>when, recurring incessantly to
                            pretended<lb break="yes"/>contrasts between the two worlds, it was<lb break="yes"/>imagined, that the whole of
                            Africa and<lb break="yes"/>of America resembled the deserts of Egypt<lb break="yes"/>and the marshes of
                            Cayenne. At present,<lb break="yes"/>when men judge of the state of things not<lb break="yes"/>from one type
                            arbitrarily chosen, but from<lb break="yes"/>positive knowledge, it is ascertained, that<lb break="yes"/>the two
                            continents, in their immense ex-<lb break="no"/>tent, contain countries that are altogether<lb break="yes"/>analogous. There are regions of America as<lb break="yes"/>barren and burning as the interior
                            of Africa.<lb break="yes"/>The islands that produce the spices of<lb break="yes"/>India are scarcely remarkable
                            for their<lb break="yes"/>dryness; and it is not on account of the hu-<lb break="no"/>midity of the climate, as
                            it has been affirmed<lb break="yes"/>in recent works, that the New Continent<lb break="yes"/>is deprived of
                            those fine species of laurine&#x00E6;<lb break="yes"/>and myristic&#x00E6;, which are found united in<lb break="yes"/>one
                            little corner of the earth in the Archi-<lb break="no"/>pelago of India. For some years past,
                            the<lb break="yes"/>real cinnamon has been cultivated with<lb break="yes"/>success in several parts of the New
                            Con-<lb break="no"/>tinent; and a zone, that produces the cou-<lb break="no"/>marouna, the vanilla, the pucheri,
                            the pine-<lb break="no"/>apple, the myrtus pimenta, the balsam of<lb break="yes"/>tolu, the myroxylon
                            peruvianum, the cro-<lb break="no"/>tons, the citrosmas, the pejoa, the <hi rendition="#i">incienso</hi><lb break="yes"/>of the Silla of
                            Caraccas, the <hi rendition="#i">quereme</hi>, the<lb break="yes"/>pancratium, and so many majestic liliaceous<lb break="yes"/>plants,
                            cannot be considered as destitute of<lb break="yes"/>aromatics. Besides, a dry air favours the<lb break="yes"/>developement of the aromatic, or exciting<lb break="yes"/>properties, only in certain species of plants.<lb break="yes"/>The most cruel poisons are produced in the<lb break="yes"/>most humid zone of America;
                            and it is pre-<lb break="no"/>cisely under the influence of the long rains of<lb break="yes"/>the tropics, that
                            the American pimento, cap-<lb break="no"/>sicum baccatum, the fruit of which is often<lb break="yes"/>as caustic
                            and fiery as Indian pepper, vege-<lb break="no"/>tates best. From the whole of these
                            con-<lb break="no"/>siderations it follows, 1st, that the New Con-<lb break="no"/>tinent possesses spices,
                            aromatics, and very<lb break="yes"/>active vegetable poisons, that are peculiar<lb break="yes"/>to itself,
                            differing specifically from those of<lb break="yes"/>the ancient world; 2dly, that the primi-<lb break="no"/>tive
                            distribution of species in the torrid<lb break="yes"/>zone cannot be explained by the influence<lb break="yes"/>of climate solely, or by the distribution of<lb break="yes"/>temperature, which we observe in
                            the pre-<lb break="no"/>sent state of our planet; but that this dif-<lb break="no"/>ference of climates leads us to
                            perceive,<lb break="yes"/>why a given type of organization developes<lb break="yes"/>itself more vigorously in
                            such or such local<lb break="yes"/>circumstances. We can conceive, that a<lb break="yes"/>small number of the
                            families of plants, for<lb break="yes"/>instance the musace&#x00E6; and the palms, can-<lb break="no"/>not belong to
                            very cold regions, on account<lb break="yes"/>of their internal structure and the import-<lb break="no"/>ance of
                            certain organs; but we cannot ex-<lb break="no"/>plain why no one of the family of melas-<lb break="no"/>tomas
                            vegetates north of the parallel of<lb break="yes"/>thirty degrees, or why no rose-tree belongs<lb break="yes"/>to the southern hemisphere. Analogy of<lb break="yes"/>climates is often found in the two
                            continents,<lb break="yes"/>without identity of productions.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>Here follow some very curious observations<lb break="yes"/>on the difference of colours in rivers, springs,<lb break="yes"/></p><cb/><pb n="390" facs="#f0008"/><p>and lakes; but we must pass them, and<lb break="yes"/>from the Oroonoko <hi rendition="#i">portage</hi> our readers<lb break="yes"/>across by Pimichin to the Rio Negro, on<lb break="yes"/>the frontiert of Brazil. Here is seen in all<lb break="yes"/>its majesty the <hi rendition="#i">phiguao</hi> of pirajao palm.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;Its trunk,
                    armed with thorns, is more<lb break="yes"/>than sixty feet high; its leaves are pin-<lb break="no"/>nated,
                    very thin, undulated, and frizzled<lb break="yes"/>towards the points. Nothing is more ex-<lb break="no"/>traordinary than the fruits of this tree;<lb break="yes"/>every cluster contains from fifty to eighty;<lb break="yes"/>they are yellow like apples, grow purple in<lb break="yes"/>proportion as they ripen, two or
                    three<lb break="yes"/>inches thick; and generally, from abortion,<lb break="yes"/>without a kernel. Among
                    the eighty or<lb break="yes"/>ninety species of palm-trees that are pecu-<lb break="no"/>liar to the New Continent,&#x201D; adds Mr. H.,<lb break="yes"/>&#x201C;which I have enumerated in the <hi rendition="#i">Nova<lb break="yes"/>Genera Plantarum &#x00E6;quinoctialum</hi>, there<lb break="yes"/>are none in which the sarcocarp is deve-<lb break="no"/>loped in a manner so extraordinary.
                    The<lb break="yes"/>fruit of the <hi rendition="#i">pirijao</hi> furnishes a farinaceous<lb break="yes"/>substance, as yellow as the
                    yolk of an egg,<lb break="yes"/>slightly saccharine, and extremely nutri-<lb break="no"/>tious. It is eaten
                    like plantains or potatoes,<lb break="yes"/>boiled or roasted in the ashes, and affords<lb break="yes"/>an aliment as wholesome as it is agreeable.<lb break="yes"/>The Indians and the missionaries are
                    un-<lb break="no"/>wearied in their praises of this noble palm-<lb break="hyph-yes"/>tree, which might be called
                    the <hi rendition="#i">peach palm</hi>,<lb break="yes"/>and which we found cultivated in abundance<lb break="yes"/>at San Fernando, San
                    Balthasar, Santa<lb break="yes"/>Barbara, and wherever we advanced toward<lb break="yes"/>the south or the
                    east along the banks of<lb break="yes"/>the Atabapo and the Upper Oroonoko.<lb break="yes"/>In those wild
                    regions are we involuntarily<lb break="yes"/>reminded of the assertion of Linn&#x00E6;us, that<lb break="yes"/>the
                    country of palm-trees was the first<lb break="yes"/>abode of our species, and that man is
                    es-<lb break="no"/>sentially <hi rendition="#i">palmivorous</hi>. On examining the<lb break="yes"/>provision accumulated in the huts
                    of the<lb break="yes"/>Indians, we perceive, that their subsistence,<lb break="yes"/>during several months of
                    the year, depends<lb break="yes"/>as much on the farinaceous fruit of the<lb break="yes"/><hi rendition="#i">pirijao</hi>, as on the
                    cassava and plantain.<lb break="yes"/>The tree bears fruit but once a year, but to<lb break="yes"/>the
                    amount of three clusters, consequently<lb break="yes"/>from one hundred and fifty, to two
                    hun-<lb break="no"/>dred fruits.&#x201D;</p><p>Here, also, is the gigantic bombax (<hi rendition="#i">bom-<lb break="no"/>bax ceila</hi>) one of which, as they sailed along,<lb break="yes"/>attracted the notice of the travellers, and<lb break="yes"/>they
                        landed to measure it. &#x201C;The height<lb break="yes"/>(we are told) was nearly one hundred and<lb break="yes"/>twenty
                        feet, and the diameter between<lb break="yes"/>fourteen and fifteen. This enormous effort<lb break="yes"/>of vegetation surprised us the more, as we<lb break="yes"/>had, till then, seen on the banks
                        of the Ata-<lb break="no"/>bapo, only small trees with slender trunks,<lb break="yes"/>which from afar
                        resembled young cherry-<lb break="hyph-yes"/>trees. The Indians assured us, that these<lb break="yes"/>small trees do
                        not form a very extensive<lb break="yes"/>group. They are checked in their growth<lb break="yes"/>by the
                        inundations of the river; while the<lb break="yes"/>dry grounds near the Atabapo, the Temi,<lb break="yes"/>and the Tuamini, furnish excellent timber<lb break="yes"/>for building.&#x201D;</p><p>Nor is
                            animal inferior to vegetable life.</p><p>&#x201C;The river Atabapo displays every-<lb break="no"/>where a peculiar aspect; you see nothing of<lb break="yes"/>its real banks formed by
                                flat lands eight or<lb break="yes"/>ten feet high; they are concealed by a row<lb break="yes"/>of palms, and
                                small trees with slender<lb break="yes"/>trunks, the roots of which are bathed by<lb break="yes"/><cb/>the
                                waters. There are many crocodiles<lb break="yes"/>from the point where you quit the Oroonoko<lb break="yes"/>to the mission of San Fernando, and their<lb break="yes"/>presence indicates, as we have said above,<lb break="yes"/>that this part
                                of the river belongs to the<lb break="yes"/>Rio Guaviare and not to the Atabapo. In<lb break="yes"/>the real
                                bed of the latter river, above the<lb break="yes"/>mission of San Fernando, there are no lon-<lb break="no"/>ger any
                                crocodiles: we find there some<lb break="yes"/><hi rendition="#i">bavas</hi>, a great many <hi rendition="#i">fresh-water dolphins</hi>,<lb break="yes"/>but
                                no manatees. We also seek in vain<lb break="yes"/>on those banks the thick-nosed tapir,
                                the<lb break="yes"/>araguates, or great howling monkeys, the<lb break="yes"/>zamuro, or vultur aura, and the
                                crested<lb break="yes"/>pheasant, known by the name of <hi rendition="#i">guacharaca</hi>.<lb break="yes"/>Enormous water-snakes, in
                                shape resem-<lb break="no"/>bling the boa, are unfortunately very com-<lb break="no"/>mon, and are dangerous
                                to Indians<lb break="yes"/>who bathe. We saw them almost from<lb break="yes"/>the first day, swimming by the side of our<lb break="yes"/>canoe; they were at most twelve or<lb break="yes"/>fourteen feet
                                long. The jaguars of the<lb break="yes"/>banks of the Atabapo and the Temi are<lb break="yes"/>large and
                                well fed; they are said, however,<lb break="yes"/>to be less daring than the jaguars of the<lb break="yes"/>Orinoco.&#x201D;</p><p>Thus (as we have stated), interspersed<lb break="yes"/>with
                anecdote, does Mr. Humboldt vary his<lb break="yes"/>entertaining volumes; and that our
                    review<lb break="yes"/>may partake of the character of its subject,<lb break="yes"/>we shall conclude
                    the present division of it<lb break="yes"/>by copying a very affecting story.
                    Where<lb break="yes"/>the Atabapo enters the Rio Temi, the nar-<lb break="no"/>rative
                                    says:</p><p>&#x201C;Before we reached its confluence,a<lb break="yes"/>granitic hummock, that rises on
                                        the western<lb break="yes"/>bank, near the mouth of the Guasacavi,<lb break="yes"/>fixed our attention; it is
                                        called the <hi rendition="#i">Rock of<lb break="yes"/>the Guahiba woman</hi>, or the Rock of the<lb break="yes"/>Mother, <hi rendition="#i">Piedra de la Madre</hi>. We inquired<lb break="yes"/>the cause of so singular a denomination.<lb break="yes"/>Father Zea could not satisfy our curiosity;<lb break="yes"/>but some weeks after, another
                                        missionary,<lb break="yes"/>one of the predecessors of that ecclesiastic,<lb break="yes"/>whom we found settled
                                        at San Fernando<lb break="yes"/>as president of the missions, related to us an<lb break="yes"/>event, which I recorded in my journal, and<lb break="yes"/>which
                                        excited in our minds the most pain-<lb break="no"/>ful feelings. If, in these solitary scenes,<lb break="yes"/>man scarcely leaves behind him any trace<lb break="yes"/>of his existence, it is doubly
                                        humiliating<lb break="yes"/>for a European to see perpetuated by the<lb break="yes"/>name of a rock, by one of those imperish-<lb break="no"/>able monuments of nature, the remem-<lb break="no"/>brance of the moral degradation of our<lb break="yes"/>species, and
                                        the contrast between the vir-<lb break="no"/>tue of a savage, and the barbarism of ci-<lb break="no"/>vilized
                                        man!</p><p>&#x201C;In 1797 the missionary of San Fer-<lb break="no"/>nando had led his Indians to
                                            the banks of<lb break="yes"/>the Rio Guaviare, on one of those hostile<lb break="yes"/>incursions which are
                                            prohibited alike by<lb break="yes"/>religion and the Spanish laws. They found<lb break="yes"/>in an Indian hut, a
                                            Guahiba woman with<lb break="yes"/>three children, two of whom were still infants.<lb break="yes"/>They were occupied
                                            in preparing the flour of<lb break="yes"/>Cassava. Resistance was impossible; the<lb break="yes"/>father was
                                            gone to fish, and the mother<lb break="yes"/>tried in vain to flee with her children.<lb break="yes"/>Scarcely
                                            had she reached the savannah,<lb break="yes"/>when she was seized by the Indians of the<lb break="yes"/>mission,
                                            who go to <hi rendition="#i">hunt men</hi>, like the<lb break="yes"/>whites and the negroes in Africa. The<lb break="yes"/>mother and
                                            her children were bound, and<lb break="yes"/><cb/>dragged to the bank of the river. The<lb break="yes"/>monk, seated
                                            in his boat, waited the issue<lb break="yes"/>of an expedition, of which he partook not<lb break="yes"/>the
                                            danger. Had the mother made too<lb break="yes"/>violent a resistance, the Indians would<lb break="yes"/>have
                                            killed her, for every thing is per-<lb break="no"/>mitted when they go to the conquest of<lb break="yes"/> souls
                                            (<hi rendition="#i">à la conquista espiritual</hi>), and it is<lb break="yes"/>children in particular they seek to capture,<lb break="yes"/>in order to treat them, in the mission,<lb break="yes"/>as <hi rendition="#i">poitos</hi>, or slaves of the Christians. The<lb break="yes"/>prisoners were carried to San Fernando in<lb break="yes"/>the hope, that the mother would be
                                            un-<lb break="no"/>able to find her way back to her home,<lb break="yes"/>by land. Far from those
                                            children who had<lb break="yes"/>accompanied their father on the day in<lb break="yes"/>which she had been
                                            carried off, this un-<lb break="no"/>happy woman showed signs of the deepest<lb break="yes"/>despair. She
                                            attempted to take back to<lb break="yes"/>her family the children who had been<lb break="yes"/>snatched away by the
                                            missionary, and fled<lb break="yes"/>with them repeatedly from the village of<lb break="yes"/>San Fernando, but the Indians never failed<lb break="yes"/>to seize her anew; and the missionary,<lb break="yes"/>after having
                                            caused her to be mercilessly<lb break="yes"/>beaten, took the cruel resolution of sepa-<lb break="no"/>rating the
                                            mother from the two children,<lb break="yes"/>who had been carried off with her. She<lb break="yes"/>was conveyed
                                            alone toward the missions of<lb break="yes"/>the Rio Negro, going up the Atabapo.<lb break="yes"/>Slightly bound,
                                            she was seated at the bow<lb break="yes"/>of the boat, ignorant of the fate that awaited<lb break="yes"/>her;
                                            but she judged, by the direction of<lb break="yes"/>the sun, that she was removed farther and<lb break="yes"/>farther from her hut and her native country.<lb break="yes"/>She succeeded in breaking her
                                            bonds, threw<lb break="yes"/>herself into the water, and swam to the<lb break="yes"/>left bank of the Atabapo.
                                            The current<lb break="yes"/>carried her to a shelf of rock, which<lb break="yes"/>bears her name to this day.
                                            She landed,<lb break="yes"/>and took shelter in the woods, but the pre-<lb break="no"/>sident of the missions
                                            ordered the Indians<lb break="yes"/>to row to the shore, and follow the traces<lb break="yes"/>of the Guahibi.
                                            In the evening she was<lb break="yes"/>brought back. Stretched upon the rock<lb break="yes"/>(<hi rendition="#i">la Piedra de la
                                                Madre</hi>) a cruel punishment<lb break="yes"/>was inflicted on her with those straps of<lb break="yes"/>manatee
                                            leather, which serve for whips in<lb break="yes"/>that country, and with which the alcades<lb break="yes"/>are
                                            always furnished. This unhappy wo-<lb break="no"/>man, her hands tied behind her back with<lb break="yes"/>strong
                                            stalks of <hi rendition="#i">mavacure</hi>, was then dragged<lb break="yes"/>to the mission of Javita.</p><p>&#x201C;She
                                                was there thrown into one of the<lb break="yes"/>caravanseras that are called <hi rendition="#i">Casas del Rey</hi>.<lb break="yes"/>It was
                                                the rainy season, and the night was<lb break="yes"/>profoundly dark. Forests, till then believed<lb break="yes"/>to be impenetrable, separated the mission<lb break="yes"/>of Javita from that of San Fernando,
                                                which<lb break="yes"/>was twenty-five leagues distant in a straight<lb break="yes"/>line. No other route is
                                                known than that of<lb break="yes"/>the rivers; no man ever attempted to go<lb break="yes"/>by land from one
                                                village to another, were<lb break="yes"/>they only a few leagues apart. But such<lb break="yes"/>difficulties could not stop a mother, who is<lb break="yes"/>separated
                                                from her children. Her children<lb break="yes"/>are at San Fernando de Atabapo; she must<lb break="yes"/>find them again, she must execute her pro-<lb break="no"/>ject of delivering them from  the hands of<lb break="yes"/>Christians, of bringing them back to their<lb break="yes"/>father on the banks of the Guaviare. The<lb break="yes"/>Guahibi was carelessly guarded in the ca-<lb break="no"/>ravansera. Her
                                                arms being wounded, the<lb break="yes"/>Indians of Javita had loosened her bonds,<lb break="yes"/><cb/><pb n="391" facs="#f0009"/>unknown to the
                                                missionary and the al-<lb break="no"/>cades. She succeeded by the help of her<lb break="yes"/>teeth in
                                                breaking them entirely; disap-<lb break="no"/>peared during the night; and at the fourth<lb break="yes"/>rising sun was seen at the mission of San<lb break="yes"/>Fernando, hovering around the hut where<lb break="yes"/>her children were confined. &#x2018;What that<lb break="yes"/>woman performed,&#x2019; added the missionary<lb break="yes"/>who gave us this sad narrative, &#x2018;the most<lb break="yes"/>robust Indian would not have ventured
                                                to<lb break="yes"/>undertake. She traversed the woods at a<lb break="yes"/>season when the sky is constantly
                                                covered<lb break="yes"/>with clouds, and the sun during whole days<lb break="yes"/>appears but for a few
                                                minutes. Did the<lb break="yes"/>course of the waters direct her way? The<lb break="yes"/>inundations of the
                                                rivers forced her to go<lb break="yes"/>far from the banks of the main stream,<lb break="yes"/>through the midst
                                                of woods where the<lb break="yes"/>movement of the waters is almost imper-<lb break="no"/>ceptible. How often must
                                                she have been<lb break="yes"/>stopped by the thorny lianas, that form a<lb break="yes"/>network around the
                                                trunks they entwine?<lb break="yes"/>How often must she have swum across the<lb break="yes"/>rivulets, that run
                                                into the Atabapo! This<lb break="yes"/>unfortunate woman was asked how she<lb break="yes"/>had sustained herself
                                                during four days!<lb break="yes"/>She said, that, exhausted with fatigue, she<lb break="yes"/>could find no other
                                                nourishment than those<lb break="yes"/>great black ants called <hi rendition="#i">vachacos</hi>, which<lb break="yes"/>climb the trees
                                                in long bands, to suspend<lb break="yes"/>on them their resinous nests.&#x2019; We pressed<lb break="yes"/>the
                                                missionary to tell us, whether the<lb break="yes"/>Guahibi had peacefully enjoyed the happi-<lb break="no"/>ness
                                                of remaining with her children; and<lb break="yes"/>if any repentance had followed this excess<lb break="yes"/>of cruelty. He would not satisfy our cu-<lb break="no"/>riosity; but at our return from the Rio<lb break="yes"/>Negro we learnt, that the Indian mother<lb break="yes"/>was not allowed time to cure her wounds,<lb break="yes"/>but was again separated from her children,<lb break="yes"/>and sent to one of the missions of the<lb break="yes"/>Upper Oroonoko. There she died, re-<lb break="no"/>fusing
                                                all kind of nourishment, as sa-<lb break="no"/>vages do in great

            <p>This journal is so pregnant with instruc-<lb break="no"/>tive and interesting matter, that we
                    could<lb break="yes"/>hardly, as we think, place any thing better<lb break="yes"/>before our readers,
                    though we might be<lb break="yes"/>more instant with a greater variety of
                    no-<lb break="no"/>velty. We therefore continue our extracts.<lb break="yes"/>The following is
                a curious account of the<lb break="yes"/><hi rendition="#i">Indian Rubber</hi>:&#x2014;&#x201C;Here (says Mr. H. at<lb break="yes"/>the mission of St. Balthasar on the Atobapo)<lb break="yes"/>we saw, for the first time, that white
                and<lb break="yes"/>fungous substance, which I have made<lb break="yes"/>known by the name of
                <hi rendition="#i">dapicho</hi> and <hi rendition="#i">zapis.</hi><lb break="yes"/>We immediately
                perceived, that it was ana-<lb break="no"/>logous to the <hi rendition="#i">elastic
                    resin;</hi> but, as the In-<lb break="no"/>dians made us understand by signs,
                that it<lb break="yes"/>was found under ground, we were inclined<lb break="yes"/>to think, till we
                arrived at the mission of<lb break="yes"/>Javita, that the <hi rendition="#i"
                    >dapicho</hi> was a fossil caout-<lb break="no"/>chouc, though different from the elastic<lb break="yes"/>bitumen of Derbyshire. A Poimisano In-<lb break="no"/>dian, seated by the fire, in the hut of the<lb break="yes"/>missionary, was employed in reducing the<lb break="yes"/><hi rendition="#i">dapicho</hi> into black caoutchouc. He had<lb break="yes"/>spitted several bits on a slender stick, and<lb break="yes"/>was roasting them
                like meat. The <hi rendition="#i">dapicho</hi><lb break="yes"/>blackens in proportion as it grows softer,<lb break="yes"/>and gains in elasticity. The resinous and<lb break="yes"/>aromatic smell, which filled the hut, seem-<lb break="no"/>ed to indicate, that this
                coloration is the<lb break="yes"/><cb/>effect of the decomposition of a carburet of<lb break="yes"/>hydrogen, and that the carbon appears in<lb break="yes"/>proportion as the
                hydrogen burns at a low<lb break="yes"/>heat. The Indian beat the softened and<lb break="yes"/>blackened mass with a piece of brazil wood,<lb break="yes"/>ending in form of a club; he then kneaded<lb break="yes"/>the <hi rendition="#i">dapicho</hi> into balls of three or four inches<lb break="yes"/>in diameter, and
                let it cool. These balls<lb break="yes"/>exactly resemble the caoutchouc of the<lb break="yes"/>shops, but their surface remains in general<lb break="yes"/>slightly viscous. They are used at San Bal-<lb break="no"/>thasar in the Indian
                game of tennis, which<lb break="yes"/>is so celebrated among the inhabitants of<lb break="yes"/>Uruana and Encaramada; they are cut into<lb break="yes"/>cylinders, to be used as
                corks, and are far<lb break="yes"/>preferable to those made of the bark of the<lb break="yes"/>cork-tree.&#x201D;</p><lb break="yes"/><p>Soon after, the travellers obtained
                    precise<lb break="yes"/>information respecting this substance:&#x2014;<lb break="yes"/>it was shown
                    them at the depth of two or<lb break="yes"/>three feet, in a marshy soil, &#x201C;between<lb break="yes"/>the
                    roots of two trees known by the name<lb break="yes"/>of the <hi rendition="#i"
                    >jacio</hi> and the
                    <hi rendition="#i">curvana.</hi> The first is the<lb break="yes"/>hevea of
                    Aublet, or siphonia of the modern<lb break="yes"/>botanists, known to furnish the caoutchouc<lb break="yes"/>of commerce in Cayenne and the Grand<lb break="yes"/>Para; the second has
                    pinnate leaves, and<lb break="yes"/>its juice is milky, but very thin, and almost<lb break="yes"/>destitute of viscosity. The <hi rendition="#i">dapicho</hi> appears<lb break="yes"/>to be the result of an extravasation of the<lb break="yes"/>sap from the roots. This extravasation<lb break="yes"/>takes place more especially when the trees<lb break="yes"/>have attained agreat age,
                    and the interior<lb break="yes"/>of the trunk begins to decay. The bark and<lb break="yes"/>alburnum
                    crack; and thus is effected na-<lb break="no"/>turally, what the art of man performs to<lb break="yes"/>collect in abundance the milky juices of<lb break="yes"/>the hevea, the castilloa, and the caoutchouc<lb break="yes"/>fig tree.&#x201D;</p><p>The River Temi, near the banks of which<lb break="yes"/>this production is found in sufficient

                        overshadow it in so wild and<lb break="yes"/>luxuriant a manner as almost to
                        mingle to-<lb break="no"/>gether the creatures of the several elements<lb break="yes"/>of air, earth, and water, and realize the<lb break="yes"/>classic images:</p><lb

                    the river; and we went up<lb break="yes"/>toward the south, across the forest, through<lb break="yes"/>paths <hi rendition="#i">(sendas)</hi>, that is,
                    through open chan-<lb break="no"/>nels of four or five feet broad. The depth<lb break="yes"/>of the water seldom exceeds half a fathom.<lb break="yes"/>These <hi rendition="#i">sendas</hi> are formed in the inundated<lb break="yes"/>forest-like paths on dry ground. The In-<lb break="no"/>dians, in going from one mission to another,<lb break="yes"/>pass with their boats as much as possible<lb break="yes"/>by the
                    same way; but the communications<lb break="yes"/>not being frequent, the force of
                    vegetation<lb break="yes"/>sometimes produces unexpected obstacles.<lb break="yes"/>An Indian,
                    furnished with a <hi rendition="#i">machette</hi> (a great<lb break="yes"/>knife, the blade of which is fourteen inches<lb break="yes"/>long,) stood at the
                    head of our boat, em-<lb break="no"/>ployed continually in chopping off the<lb break="yes"/>branches that cross each other from the<lb break="yes"/>two sides of the
                    channel. In the thickest<lb break="yes"/>part of the forest we were
                    astonished by an<lb break="yes"/>extraordinary noise. On beating the bushes,<lb break="yes"/><cb/><pb n="406" facs="#f0011"/>a shoal of <hi rendition="#i">toninas</hi> (fresh water dolphins)
                    four<lb break="yes"/>feet long, surrounded our boat. These ani-<lb break="no"/>mals had concealed themselves beneath the<lb break="yes"/>branches of a fromager or bombax ceiba.<lb break="yes"/>They fled across the forest, throwing out<lb break="yes"/>those
                    spouts of compressed air and water,<lb break="yes"/>which have given them in every language<lb break="yes"/>the name of <hi rendition="#i">blowers.</hi> How singular was this<lb break="yes"/>spectacle in the middle of the land, three<lb break="yes"/>or four hundred leagues from the mouths of<lb break="yes"/>the Oroonoko and the Amazon! I am not<lb break="yes"/>ignorant, that
                    the pleuronectes of the At-<lb break="no"/>lantic go up the Loire as far as Orleans;
                    but<lb break="yes"/>I persist in thinking, that the dolphins of<lb break="yes"/>the Temi, like
                    those of the Ganges, and<lb break="yes"/>like the skate <hi rendition="#i"
                        >(raia)</hi> of the Oroonoko, are<lb break="yes"/>of species essentially
                    different from the dol-<lb break="no"/>phins and skates of the ocean. In the im-<lb break="no"/>mense
                    rivers of South America, and the<lb break="yes"/>great lakes of North America, nature seems<lb break="yes"/>to repeat several pelagic forms. The Nile<lb break="yes"/>has no porpoises: those of the sea go up the<lb break="yes"/>Delta no farther
                    than Biana and Metonbis<lb break="yes"/>toward Selamoun.&#x201D;</p><p>But these <hi rendition="#i">fishes among the woods</hi>, though<lb break="yes"/>the most singular, were not the most un-<lb break="no"/>grateful of the animal creation to the startled<lb break="yes"/>Europeans. About this region they had to<lb break="yes"/>stop to be cured of an evil under which they<lb break="yes"/>suffered for two days. The author thus des-<lb break="no"/>cribes it:&#x2014;&#x201C;We felt an extraordinary irri-<lb break="no"/>tation on the joints of our fingers,
                        and on<lb break="yes"/>the backs of our hands. The missionary<lb break="yes"/>told us it was caused by the <hi rendition="#i">aradores</hi>,<lb break="yes"/>(ploughman insects), which get under the<lb break="yes"/>skin. We could distinguish with a lens<lb break="yes"/>nothing but streaks, or parallel and whitish<lb break="yes"/>furrows. It is the form of these
                        furrows,<lb break="yes"/>that has obtained this insect the name of<lb break="yes"/><hi rendition="#i">ploughman</hi>. A mulatto woman was

                        little<lb break="yes"/>bit of hard wood, and dug with this<lb break="yes"/>point the furrows that marked the skin.<lb break="yes"/>After long researches, she announced with<lb break="yes"/>the pedantic gravity peculiar to the
                        mulatto<lb break="yes"/>race, that an <hi rendition="#i">arador</hi> was found. I saw a<lb break="yes"/>little round bag, which I suspected
                        to be<lb break="yes"/>the egg of an acarus. I was to find relief,<lb break="yes"/>when the mulatto woman had
                        succeeded in<lb break="yes"/>taking out three or four of these <hi rendition="#i">aradores</hi>.<lb break="yes"/>Having the skin of both
                        hands filled with<lb break="yes"/>acari, I had not the patience to wait the end of<lb break="yes"/>an operation,
                        which had already lasted till<lb break="yes"/>late at night. The next day an Indian of<lb break="yes"/>Javita cured
                        us radically, and with surpris-<lb break="no"/>ing promptitude.&#x201D;&#x2014;The medicament con-<lb break="no"/>sisted of an infusion of shrub called <hi rendition="#i">uzao</hi>.</p><p>The annexed notice of the religious opi-<lb break="no"/>nions of the natives has something very<lb break="yes"/>sublime in it:&#x2014;&#x201C;The nations of the

                            Persians,<lb break="yes"/>have no other worship than that of the<lb break="yes"/>powers of nature. They call the
                            good prin-<lb break="no"/>ciple <hi rendition="#i">Cachimana</hi>; it is the <hi rendition="#i">Manitou</hi>, the<lb break="yes"/>Great Spirit, that regulates the

                            Indians of the<lb break="yes"/>forest, when they visit occasionally the mis-<lb break="no"/>sions, conceive with
                            difficulty the idea of<lb break="yes"/>a temple or an image. &#x201C;These good people,&#x201D;<lb break="yes"/>said the

                            patron festival my village, that of<lb break="yes"/>San Antonio, the Indians of Inirida were<lb break="yes"/>present at mass. &#x2018;Your God,&#x2019; said they to<lb break="yes"/>me, &#x2018;keeps himself shut up in a house, as<lb break="yes"/>if he were old and infirm; ours is in the<lb break="yes"/>forest, in the fields, and on the mountains<lb break="yes"/>of Sipapu, whence the rains come.&#x2019;<choice><sic>&#x2019;</sic><corr type="editorial">&#x201D;</corr></choice> Among<lb break="yes"/>the more numerous, and on this
                            account<lb break="yes"/>less barbarous tribes, religious societies of a<lb break="yes"/>singular kind are formed.
                            Some old Indians<lb break="yes"/>pretend to be better instructed than others<lb break="yes"/>in what regards the divinity; and to them<lb break="yes"/>is confined the famous <hi rendition="#i">botuto</hi>, of which I<lb break="yes"/>have spoken, and
                            which is sounded under<lb break="yes"/>the palm-trees, that they may bear abun-<lb break="no"/>dance of fruit. On the
                            banks of the Oroo-<lb break="no"/>noko there exists no idol, as among all the<lb break="yes"/>nations who have
                            remained faithful to the<lb break="yes"/>first worship of nature, but the <hi rendition="#i">botuto</hi>, the<lb break="yes"/>sacred
                            trumpet, is become an object of vene-<lb break="no"/>ration. To be initiated into the mysteries<lb break="yes"/>of the
                            <hi rendition="#i">botuto</hi>, it is requisite to have pure<lb break="yes"/>manners, and to have lived single. The<lb break="yes"/>initiated are subjected to flagellations, fast-<lb break="no"/>ings, and other painful exercises.
                            There<lb break="yes"/>are but a small number of these sacred<lb break="yes"/>trumpets. The most anciently celebrated<lb break="yes"/>is that upon a hill near the confluence of<lb break="yes"/>the Tomo and the Guainia. It is
                            pretended,<lb break="yes"/>that it is heard at once on the banks of the<lb break="yes"/>Tuamini, and at the mission
                            of San Miguel<lb break="yes"/>de Davipe, a distance of ten leagues. Father<lb break="yes"/>Cereso assured us, that
                            the Indians speak<lb break="yes"/>of the <hi rendition="#i">botuto</hi> of Tomo as an object of wor-<lb break="no"/>ship common to many
                            surrounding tribes.<lb break="yes"/>Fruit and intoxicating liquors are placed by<lb break="yes"/>the sacred
                            trumpet. Sometimes the Great<lb break="yes"/>Spirit <hi rendition="#i">(Cuchimana)</hi> himself makes the <hi rendition="#i">bo-<lb break="no"/>tuto</hi> resound; sometimes he
                            is content to<lb break="yes"/>manifest his will by him, to whom the kee-<lb break="no"/>ping of the instrument is
                            entrusted. These<lb break="yes"/>juggleries being very ancient (from the fa-<lb break="no"/>thers of our fathers, say
                            the Indians), we<lb break="yes"/>must not be surprised, that some incredulous<lb break="yes"/>are already to be
                            found; but these express<lb break="yes"/>their disbelief of the mysteries of the <hi rendition="#i">botuto</hi><lb break="yes"/>only in
                            whispers. Women are not permitted<lb break="yes"/>to see this marvellous instrument; and are<lb break="yes"/>excluded from all the ceremonies of this wor-<lb break="no"/>ship.

                taking up a night&#x2019;s lodging, we are<lb break="yes"/>told &#x2014;&#x201D;
                Before we took possession of the<lb break="yes"/>deserted hut, the Indians killed
                two great<lb break="yes"/>
                <choice><sic><hi rendition="#i">mapanarc</hi></sic><corr type="editorial"><hi
                            rendition="#i">mapanare</hi></corr></choice> serpents. These grow to
                four or<lb break="yes"/>five feet long. They appeared to me to be<lb break="yes"
                />the same species as those I described in<lb break="yes"/>the Rio Magdalena. It is
                a beautiful ani-<lb break="no"/>mal, but extremely venomous, white below<lb
                    break="yes"/>the belly, and spotted with brown and red<lb break="yes"/>on the
                back. As the inside of the hut was<lb break="yes"/>filled with grass, and as we lay
                upon the<lb break="yes"/>ground, there being no means of suspending<lb break="yes"
                />our hammocks, we were not without in-<lb break="no"/>quietude during the night. In
                the morn-<lb break="no"/>ing a large viper was found on lifting up<lb break="yes"
                />from the ground the jaguar skin, upon<lb break="yes"/>which one of our domestics
                had slept. The<lb break="yes"/>Indians say, that these reptiles, slow in their<lb
                    break="yes"/>movements when they are not pursued, creep<lb break="yes"/>near a
                man because they are fond of heat.<lb break="yes"/>In fact, on the banks of the
                Magdalena a<lb break="yes"/><cb/>serpent entered the bed of one of our fel-<lb break="no"
                />low travellers, where he remained a part of<lb break="yes"/>the night, without
                doing him any harm.<lb break="yes"/>Without wishing here to take up the de-<lb
                    break="no"/>fence of vipers and rattlesnakes, I believe<lb break="yes"/>it may
                be affirmed, that, if these venomous<lb break="yes"/>animals had such a disposition
                for offence<lb break="yes"/>as is supposed, the human species would<lb break="yes"
                />certainly not have resisted their numbers<lb break="yes"/>in some parts of
                America; for instance, on<lb break="yes"/>the banks of the Oroonoko, and the
                    humid<lb break="yes"/>mountains of Choco.&#x201D;</p>
            <lb break="yes"/>
            <p>After this the wanderers entered the Rio<lb break="yes"/>Negro, and the view here
                taken is both<lb break="yes"/>geographically good and morally affecting.<lb
                    break="yes"/>&#x2014;&#x201C;After all we had endured (observes our<lb
                    break="yes"/>interesting author), I may be permitted,<lb break="yes"/>perhaps,
                to speak of the satisfaction we felt<lb break="yes"/>in having reached the tributary
                streams of<lb break="yes"/>the Amazon, having passed the isthmus that<lb break="yes"
                />separates two great systems of rivers, and<lb break="yes"/>in being sure of having
                fulfilled the most<lb break="yes"/>important object of our voyage, the deter-<lb
                    break="no"/>mining astronomically the course of that<lb break="yes"/>arm of the Oroonoko,
                which falls into the<lb break="yes"/>Rio Negro, and of which the existence has<lb
                    break="yes"/>been alternately proved and denied during<lb break="yes"/>half a
                century. In proportion as we draw<lb break="yes"/>near to an object we have long had
                in view,<lb break="yes"/>its interest seems to augment. The unin-<lb break="no"
                />habited banks of the Cassiquiare, covered<lb break="yes"/>with forests, without
                memorials of times<lb break="yes"/>past, then occupied my imagination, as do<lb
                    break="yes"/>now the banks of the Euphrates, or the<lb break="yes"/>Oxus,
                celebrated in the annals of civilized<lb break="yes"/>nations. In that interior part
                of the New<lb break="yes"/>Continent we almost accustomed ourselves<lb break="yes"
                />to regard men as not being essential to the<lb break="yes"/>order of nature. The
                earth is loaded with<lb break="yes"/>plants, and nothing impedes their free de-<lb
                    break="no"/>velopement. An immense layer of mould<lb break="yes"/>manifests the
                uninterrupted action of or-<lb break="no"/>ganic powers. The crocodiles and the
                    boas<lb break="yes"/>are masters of the river; the jaguar, the<lb break="yes"
                />pecari, the dante, and the monkeys, tra-<lb break="no"/>verse the forest without
                fear, and without<lb break="yes"/>danger; there they dwell as in an ancient<lb
                    break="yes"/>inheritance. This aspect of animated na-<lb break="no"/>ture, in
                which man is nothing, has some-<lb break="no"/>thing in it strange and sad. To this
                    we<lb break="yes"/>reconcile ourselves with difficulty on the<lb break="yes"
                />ocean, and amid the sands of Africa; though<lb break="yes"/>in these scenes, where
                nothing recalls to<lb break="yes"/>mind our fields, our woods, and our streams,<lb
                    break="yes"/>we are less astonished at the vast solitude<lb break="yes"/>through
                which we pass. Here, in a fertile<lb break="yes"/>country adorned with eternal
                verdure, we<lb break="yes"/>seek in vain the traces of the power of<lb break="yes"
                />man; we seem to be transported into a<lb break="yes"/>world different from that
                which gave us<lb break="yes"/>birth. These impressions are so much the<lb
                    break="yes"/>more powerful, in proportion as they are of<lb break="yes"/>longer
                duration. A soldier, who had spent<lb break="yes"/>his whole life in the missions of
                the Upper<lb break="yes"/>Oroonoko, slept with us on the bank of the<lb break="yes"
                />river. He was an intelligent man, who,<lb break="yes"/>during a calm and serene
                night, pressed me<lb break="yes"/>with questions on the magnitude of the<lb
                    break="yes"/>stars, on the inhabitants of the Moon, on a<lb break="yes"
                />thousand subjects of which I was as igno-<lb break="no"/>rant as himself. Being
                unable, by my an-<lb break="no"/>swers, to satisfy his curiosity, he said to me<lb
                    break="yes"/>in a firm tone: &#x2018;With respect to men, I<lb break="yes"
                />believe there are no more above, than you<lb break="yes"/>
                <pb n="442" facs="#f0013"/>would have found, if you had gone by land<lb break="yes"
                />from Javita to Cassiquiare. I think I see<lb break="yes"/>in the stars, as here, a
                plain covered with<lb break="yes"/>grass, and a forest <hi rendition="#i">(mucho
                    monte)</hi> traversed<lb break="yes"/>by a river.&#x2019; In citing these words,
                I paint<lb break="yes"/>the impression produced by the monotonous<lb break="yes"

                <p><hi rendition="#k">A few</hi> weeks since, when this addition to<lb break="yes"/>the valuable labours of M. Humboldt appear-<lb break="no"/>ed, we paid it that immediate attention<lb break="yes"/>which a work so replete with information<lb break="yes"/>demanded; and having conducted our read-<lb break="no"/>ers through one of the two 8vo. vols. into<lb break="yes"/>which it is divided, we left the second for a<lb break="yes"/>future convenient opportunity. That oppor-<lb break="no"/>tunity the autumnal sterility of the press af-<lb break="no"/>fords us, and we return with pleasure to an<lb break="yes"/>author than whom the present period does<lb break="yes"/>not possess one more full of entertainment<lb break="yes"/>and intelligence, though addicted in too great<lb break="yes"/>a degree to the formation of general sys-<lb break="no"/>tems, and given to too much technicality of<lb break="yes"/>expression.</p><p>Without retracing, to connect our state-<lb break="no"/>ments, we will beg our readers to plant<lb break="yes"/>themselves at Esmeralda, on the Upper<lb break="yes"/>Oroonoko, the most solitary and remote<lb break="yes"/>Christian settlement in those regions. Here<lb break="yes"/>there is a bifurcation of the river, and the<lb break="yes"/>granitic mountain of Duida rises to the height<lb break="yes"/>of nearly 8,000 feet. The mission contains<lb break="yes"/>about eighty inhabitants, and yet no fewer<lb break="yes"/>than three Indian languages are spoken&#x2014;<lb break="yes"/>the Idapimanare, the Catarapenno, and the<lb break="yes"/>Maquiritan.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;Esmeralda, (says M. H.) is the most ce-<lb break="no"/>lebrated spot on the Oroonoko for the
                    fa-<lb break="no"/>brication of that active poison which is em-<lb break="no"/>ployed in war, in the
                    chase, and, what is<lb break="yes"/>singular enough, as a remedy for gastric ob-<lb break="no"/>structions. The poison of the ticunas of<lb break="yes"/>the Amazon, the upas-tieute of Java, and<lb break="yes"/>the <hi rendition="#i">curare</hi> of Guyana, are the most
                    deleteri-<lb break="no"/>ous substances that are known. Raleigh,<lb break="yes"/>toward the end
                    of the sixteenth century, had<lb break="yes"/>heard the name of <hi rendition="#i"
                        >urari</hi> pronounced as being<lb break="yes"/>a vegetable substance, with which arrows<lb break="yes"/>were envenomed; yet no fixed notions of<lb break="yes"/>this poison had
                    reached Europe. The mis-<lb break="no"/>sionaries Gumilla and Gili had not been<lb break="yes"/>able
                    to penetrate into the country where<lb break="yes"/>the curare is manufactured.
                    Gumilla as-<lb break="no"/>serts that &#x2018;this preparation was inveloped in<lb break="yes"/>great
                    mystery; that its principal ingredient<lb break="yes"/>was furnished by a
                    subterraneous plant, by<lb break="yes"/>a tuberose root, which never puts forth
                    leaves,<lb break="yes"/>and which is called the root, by way of emi-<lb break="no"/>nence, <hi
                        rendition="#i">raiz de si misma;</hi> that the venomous<lb break="yes"/>exhalations, which arise from the pots, cause<lb break="yes"/>the old women (the
                    most <hi rendition="#i">useless</hi>) to perish,<lb break="yes"/>who are chosen to watch over this operation;<lb break="yes"/><pb n="564" facs="#f0015"/>finally, that these vegetable juices never ap-<lb break="no"/>pear sufficiently concentrated, till a few<lb break="yes"/>drops produce <hi
                        rendition="#i">at a distance</hi> a repulsive action<lb break="yes"/>on the blood. An Indian wounds himself<lb break="yes"/>slightly; and a dart dipped in the
                    liquid <hi rendition="#i">curare</hi><lb break="yes"/>is held near the wound. If it
                    make the<lb break="yes"/>blood return to the vessels without having<lb break="yes"/>been brought
                    into contact with them, the<lb break="yes"/>poison is judged to be sufficiently
                    concen-<lb break="no"/>trated.&#x2019; I shall not stop to refute these po-<lb break="no"/>pular tales
                collected by Father Gumilla.</p>
            <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>&#x201C;When we (he continues) arrived at Es-<lb break="no"/>meralda, the greater part of the Indians<lb break="yes"/>were
                    returning from an excursion which they<lb break="yes"/>had made to the east beyond
                    the Rio Pada-<lb break="no"/>mo, to gather <hi rendition="#i">juvias</hi>, or the fruit of the ber-<lb break="no"/>tholletia, and the liana which yields the cu-<lb break="no"/>rare.
                    Their return was celebrated by a fes-<lb break="no"/>tival, which is called in the Mission <hi rendition="#i">la fiesta<lb break="yes"/>de las juvias</hi>, and which resembles our harvest<lb break="yes"/>homes and vintage feasts. The women had<lb break="yes"/>prepared a quantity of
                    fermented liquor, and<lb break="yes"/>during two days the Indians were in a
                    state<lb break="yes"/>of intoxication. Among nations that attach<lb break="yes"/>great
                    importance to the fruits of the palm-<lb break="no"/>trees, and of some others
                    useful for the nou-<lb break="no"/>rishment of man, the period when these<lb break="yes"/>fruits are
                    gathered is marked by public re-<lb break="no"/>joicings, and time is divided
                    according to<lb break="yes"/>these festivals, which succeed one another<lb break="yes"/>in a course
                    invariably the same. We were<lb break="yes"/>fortunate enough to find an old
                    Indian less<lb break="yes"/>drunk than the rest, who was employed in<lb break="yes"/>preparing the
                    <hi rendition="#i">curare</hi> poison from freshly-ga-<lb break="no"/>thered plants. He was the chemist of the<lb break="yes"/>place. We found at his dwelling large<lb break="yes"/>earthen pots for boiling vegetable juice,<lb break="yes"/>shallower vessels to favour the evaporation<lb break="yes"/>by a larger surface, and leaves of the plain-<lb break="no"/>tain-tree
                    rolled up in the shape of our filters,<lb break="yes"/>and used to filtrate the liquids more or less<lb break="yes"/>loaded with fibrous matter. The greatest<lb break="yes"/>order
                    and neatness prevailed in this hut,<lb break="yes"/>which was transformed into a
                    chemical labo-<lb break="no"/>ratory. The Indian who was to instruct<lb break="yes"/>us, is known
                    throughout the mission by the<lb break="yes"/>name of the <hi rendition="#i"
                        >master of poison</hi> <hi rendition="#i">(amo del curare);</hi><lb break="yes"/>he had that self-sufficient air and tone
                    of pe-<lb break="no"/>dantry, of which the pharmacopolists of Eu-<lb break="no"/>rope were formerly accused. &#x2018;I know,&#x2019; said<lb break="yes"/>he, &#x2018;that the whites have the
                    secret of fabri-<lb break="no"/>cating soap, and that black powder, which<lb break="yes"/>has the
                    defect of making a noise, and killing<lb break="yes"/>animals, when they are wanted.
                    The <hi rendition="#i">curare,</hi><lb break="yes"/>which we prepare from father to son, is su-<lb break="no"/>perior to any thing
                    you<lb break="yes"/>can make <hi rendition="#i">down yon-<lb break="no"/>der</hi> (beyond sea).
                    It is the juice of an herb<lb break="yes"/>which <hi rendition="#i">kills
                        silently</hi> (without any one knowing<lb break="yes"/>whence the stroke comes).&#x2019;</p>
            <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>&#x201C;This chemical operation, to which the<lb break="yes"/><hi rendition="#i">master of the curare</hi> attached so much im-<lb break="no"/>portance, appears to us extremely simple.<lb break="yes"/>The liana (<hi rendition="#i">bejuco</hi>), which is used at
                    Esme-<lb break="no"/>ralda for the preparation of the poison,<lb break="yes"/>bears the same name as
                    in the forests of Ja-<lb break="no"/>vita. It is the <hi rendition="#i">bejuco de
                        mavacure</hi>, which is<lb break="yes"/>gathered in abundance east of the
                    mission,<lb break="yes"/>on the left bank of the Oroonoko, beyond<lb break="yes"/>the Rio Amaguaca,
                    in the mountainous and<lb break="yes"/>granatic lands of Guanaya and Yumariquin.</p>
            <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>&#x201C;The juice of the liana, when it has been<lb break="yes"/>recently gathered, is not
                    regarded as poison-<lb break="no"/>ous; perhaps it acts in a sensible manner<lb break="yes"/>only
                    when it is strongly concentrated. It<lb break="yes"/><cb/>is the bark and a part of the
                    alburnum,<lb break="yes"/>which contains this terrible poison.&#x2014;<lb break="yes"/>Branches of the <hi
                        rendition="#i">mavacure</hi> four or five lines<lb break="yes"/>in diameter, are scraped with
                    a knife; and<lb break="yes"/>the bark that comes off is bruised, and re-<lb break="no"/>duced
                    into very thin filaments, on the stone<lb break="yes"/>employed for grinding
                    cassava. The venom-<lb break="no"/>ous juice being yellow, the whole fibrous<lb break="yes"/>mass
                    takes this colour. It is thrown into a<lb break="yes"/>funnel nine inches high,
                    with an opening<lb break="yes"/>four inches wide. This funnel was, of all<lb break="yes"/>the
                    instruments of the Indian laboratory,<lb break="yes"/>that of which the <hi
                        rendition="#i">master of poison</hi> seemed to<lb break="yes"/>be most proud.
                    He asked us repeatedly, if<lb break="yes"/><hi rendition="#i">por allà</hi> <hi
                        rendition="#i">(down yonder</hi>, that is in Europe) we<lb break="yes"/>had ever seen any
                    thing to be compared to<lb break="yes"/>his <hi rendition="#i">empudo.</hi> It
                    was a leaf of a plaintain-<lb break="no"/>tree rolled up in the form of a cone, and<lb break="yes"/>placed in another stronger cone made of the<lb break="yes"/>leaves of the palm-tree.
                    The whole of this<lb break="yes"/>apparatus was supported by slight frame-<lb break="no"/>work made
                    of the petioli and ribs of palm-<lb break="hyph-yes"/>leaves. A cold infusion is first
                    prepared by<lb break="yes"/>pouring water on the fibrous matter, which<lb break="yes"/>is the ground
                    bark of the <hi rendition="#i">mavacure.</hi> A yel-<lb break="no"/>lowish water
                    filters during several hours,<lb break="yes"/>drop by drop, through the leafy
                    funnel.<lb break="yes"/>This filtered water is the venomous liquor,<lb break="yes"/>but it acquires
                    strength only when it is con-<lb break="no"/>centrated by evaporation, like melasses
                    in a<lb break="yes"/>large earthen pot. The Indian from time to<lb break="yes"/>time invited us to
                    taste the liquid; its taste,<lb break="yes"/>more or less bitter, decides when the
                    con-<lb break="no"/>centration by fire has been carried sufficiently<lb break="yes"/>far. There is no
                    danger in this operation,<lb break="yes"/>the <hi rendition="#i">curare</hi> being
                    deleterious only when it<lb break="yes"/>comes into immediate contact with the<lb break="yes"/>blood. The vapours, therefore, that are dis-<lb break="no"/>engaged from the pans,
                    are not hurtful, not-<lb break="no"/>withstanding what has been asserted on this<lb break="yes"/>point by the missionaries of the Oroonoko.<lb break="yes"/>Fontana, in his fine
                    experiments on the poi-<lb break="no"/>son of the <hi rendition="#i">ticunas</hi> of the river of Amazons,<lb break="yes"/>long ago proved, that the
                    vapours rising<lb break="yes"/>from this poison when thrown on burning<lb break="yes"/>charcoal, may be inhaled without apprehen-<lb break="no"/>sion; and that it is
                    false as M. de la Con-<lb break="no"/>damine has announced, that Indian women,<lb break="yes"/>when
                    condemned to death, have been killed<lb break="yes"/>by the vapours of the
                    poison of the <hi rendition="#i">ticunas.</hi>&#x201D;
            </p>
            <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The juice is thickened with a glutinous<lb break="yes"/>substance to cause it to stick to the darts,<lb break="yes"/>which it renders mortal; but taken inter-<lb break="no"/>nally,
                    the Indians consider the <hi rendition="#i">curare</hi> to be<lb break="yes"/>an excellent stomachic. &#x201C;Scarcely a fowl<lb break="yes"/>is eaten (adds our author,) on the banks of<lb break="yes"/>the Oroonoko, which has not been killed<lb break="yes"/>with a poisoned arrow. The missionaries<lb break="yes"/>pretend, that the flesh of animals is never<lb break="yes"/>so good as when these means are em-<lb break="no"/>ployed. Father Zea, who accompanied<lb break="yes"/>us, though ill of a tertian fever, caused<lb break="yes"/>every morning the live fowl allotted for<lb break="yes"/>our repast to be brought to
                    his hammock,<lb break="yes"/>together with an arrow. Notwithstanding<lb break="yes"/>his
                    habitual state of weakness, he would not<lb break="yes"/>confide this
                    operation, to which he attached<lb break="yes"/>great importance, to any other
                    person.<lb break="yes"/>Large birds, a guan <hi rendition="#i">(pava de monte)</hi>
                    for in-<lb break="no"/>stance, or a curassoa <hi rendition="#i">(alector)</hi>, when
                    wound-<lb break="no"/>ed in the thigh, perish in two or three mi-<lb break="no"/>nutes; but it is
                    often ten or twelve before a<lb break="yes"/>pig or a pecari expires.&#x201D;</p><p>M. Humboldt does
                        not seem to be ac-<lb break="no"/><cb/>quainted with any certain antidote, if such<lb break="yes"/>exists,
                        to this fatal poison. Sugar, garlick,<lb break="yes"/>the muriate of soda, &amp;c. are mentioned<lb break="yes"/>doubtingly. In London, some very curious<lb break="yes"/>experiments were tried on animals, some-<lb break="no"/>what resembling those used to restore sus-<lb break="no"/>pended animation by drowning. By keep-<lb break="no"/>ing up a constant motion of the lungs (by<lb break="yes"/>inflation with bellows and expiration through<lb break="yes"/>pressure), for many hours, it was supposed<lb break="yes"/>that the creature apparently killed by the cu-<lb break="no"/>rare would revive: we are not informed<lb break="yes"/>whether the operation ever succeeded, but<lb break="yes"/>we believe that several dead horses and<lb break="yes"/>asses <hi rendition="#i">refused</hi> to come to life again! But to<lb break="yes"/>return to the narrative.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The old Indian, who was called the<lb break="yes"/><hi rendition="#i">master of poison,</hi> seemed flattered by the
                    in-<lb break="no"/>terest we had taken in his chemical pro-<lb break="no"/>cesses. He found us sufficiently
                    intelligent<lb break="yes"/>to have no doubt that we knew how to make<lb break="yes"/>soap, and, next to the fabrication of <hi rendition="#i">curare,</hi><lb break="yes"/>this art appeared to him one of the finest<lb break="yes"/>inventions of the human mind. When the<lb break="yes"/>liquid poison was poured into the vessels<lb break="yes"/>prepared for this purpose, we accompanied<lb break="yes"/>the Indian to the <hi rendition="#i">festival of the juvias</hi>. The<lb break="yes"/>harvest of <hi rendition="#i">juvias</hi>, or fruits of the <hi rendition="#i">bertholletia<lb break="yes"/>excelsa</hi>, was celebrated by dancing,
                    and the<lb break="yes"/>excesses of the most savage intoxication.<lb break="yes"/>The hut, where the natives were assembled,<lb break="yes"/>displayed, during several days, a very singu-<lb break="no"/>lar aspect. There was neither table nor<lb break="yes"/>bench, but large roasted monkeys, blackened<lb break="yes"/>by smoke, were ranged in order, resting<lb break="yes"/>against the wall. These were the <hi rendition="#i">marimon-<lb break="no"/>des</hi> (ateles belzebuth), and those bearded<lb break="yes"/>monkeys called <hi rendition="#i">capuchins</hi>, which must not be<lb break="yes"/>confounded with the weeper, or sai
                    (simia<lb break="yes"/>capucina of Buffon). The manner of roast-<lb break="no"/>ing these anthropomorphous animals
                    contri-<lb break="no"/>butes singularly to render their appearance<lb break="yes"/>disagreeable in the eyes of
                    civilized man.<lb break="yes"/>A little grating or lattice of very hard wood<lb break="yes"/>is formed, and raised
                    one foot from the<lb break="yes"/>ground. The monkey is skinned, and bent<lb break="yes"/>into a sitting posture;
                    the head generally<lb break="yes"/>resting on the arms, which are meagre and<lb break="yes"/>long; but sometimes
                    these are crossed be-<lb break="no"/>hind the back. When it is tied on the grat-<lb break="no"/>ing, a very clear fire
                    is kindled below. The<lb break="yes"/>monkey, enveloped in smoke and flame, is<lb break="yes"/>broiled and blackened
                    at the same time.<lb break="yes"/>On seeing the natives devour the arm or leg<lb break="yes"/>of a roasted monkey,
                    it is difficult not to<lb break="yes"/>believe, that this habit of eating animals,<lb break="yes"/>that so much resemblese man in their physical<lb break="yes"/>organization, has, in a certain degree, con-<lb break="no"/>tributed
                    to diminish the horror of anthropo-<lb break="no"/>phagy among savages. Roasted monkeys,<lb break="yes"/>particularly those that have a very round<lb break="yes"/>head, display a hideous resemblance to a<lb break="yes"/>child; the Europeans therefore, who are<lb break="yes"/>obliged to feed on quadrumanes, prefer se-<lb break="no"/>parating
                    the head and the hands, and serve<lb break="yes"/>up only the rest of the animal at their tables.<lb break="yes"/>The flesh of monkeys is so lean and dry,<lb break="yes"/>that Mr. Bonpland has preserved in his
                    col-<lb break="no"/>lections at Paris an arm and hand, which<lb break="yes"/>had been broiled over the fire at
                    Esmeralda;<lb break="yes"/>and no smell has arisen from them after a great<lb break="yes"/>number of years.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;We saw the Indians dance. The mono-<lb break="no"/>tony of this dance is increased by the
                    wo-<lb break="no"/><cb/><pb n="565" facs="#f0016"/>men not daring to take part in it.<lb break="yes"/>The men, young and old, form a circle, holding<lb break="yes"/>each other&#x2019;s hands, and turn sometimes to the<lb break="yes"/>right, sometimes to the left, for
                    whole hours,<lb break="yes"/>with silent gravity. Most frequently the<lb break="yes"/>dancers themselves are the
                    musicians. Fee-<lb break="no"/>ble sounds, drawn from a series of reeds of<lb break="yes"/>different lengths, form a
                    slow <choice><sic>snd</sic><corr type="editorial">and</corr></choice> plaintive<lb break="yes"/>accompaniment. The first dancer, to mark<lb break="yes"/>the time, bends both
                    knees in a kind of ca-<lb break="no"/>dence. Sometimes they all make a pause<lb break="yes"/>in their places, and
                    execute little oscillatory<lb break="yes"/>movements, bending the body from one side<lb break="yes"/>to the other.
                    These reeds ranged in a line,<lb break="yes"/>and fastened together, resemble the pipe of<lb break="yes"/>Pan, as we
                    find it represented in the bac-<lb break="no"/>chanalian processions on Grecian vases. To<lb break="yes"/>unite
                    reeds of different lengths, and make<lb break="yes"/>them sound in succession by passing them<lb break="yes"/>before
                    the lips, is a simple idea, and has natu-<lb break="no"/>rally presented itself to every nation. We<lb break="yes"/>were surprised to see with what promptitude<lb break="yes"/>the young Indians constructed and tuned<lb break="yes"/>these pipes, when they found reeds <hi rendition="#i">(carices)</hi><lb break="yes"/>on the bank of the river. Men, in
                    a state<lb break="yes"/>of nature, in every zone, make great use of<lb break="yes"/>these gramina with high stalks. The Greeks<lb break="yes"/>said with
                    truth, that reeds had contributed to<lb break="yes"/>subjugate nations by furnishing arrows, to<lb break="yes"/>soften men&#x2019;s manners by the charm of music,<lb break="yes"/>and to unfold their understanding by
                    afford-<lb break="no"/>ing the first instruments for tracing letters.<lb break="yes"/>These different uses of reeds
                    mark in some<lb break="yes"/>sort three different periods in the life of na-<lb break="no"/>tions. We must admit, that
                    the tribes of<lb break="yes"/>the Oroonoko are in the first step of<lb break="yes"/>dawning civilization. The reed
                    serves them<lb break="yes"/>only as an instrument of war and of hunt-<lb break="no"/>ing; and the Pan&#x2019;s pipes, of
                    which we have<lb break="yes"/>spoken, have not yet, on those distant shores,<lb break="yes"/>yielded sounds capable
                    of awakening mild<lb break="yes"/>and humane feelings.&#x201D;</p>
                <p>M.H. gives an interesting account of the<lb break="yes"/>Juvia, (chesnut-trees,) the harvested fruits<lb break="yes"/>of which cause the natives to rejoice so<lb break="yes"/>much; but there is another tree, the cha-<lb break="no"/>racter of which is still more curious. It is<lb break="yes"/>thus described:&#x2014;</p>
                <p>&#x201C;We saw on the slope of the Cerra<lb break="yes"/>Duida <hi rendition="#i">shirt trees</hi> fifty feet high. The
                    In-<lb break="no"/>dians cut off cylindrical pieces two feet in<lb break="yes"/>diameter, from which they peel the
                    red and<lb break="yes"/>fibrous bark, without making any longitu-<lb break="no"/>dical incision. This bark affords
                    them a<lb break="yes"/>sort of garment, which resembles sacks of<lb break="yes"/>a very coarse texture, and without
                    a seam.<lb break="yes"/>The upper opening serves for the head; and<lb break="yes"/>two lateral holes are cut to admit the
                    arms.<lb break="yes"/>The natives wear these shirts of marima in<lb break="yes"/>the rainy season:
                    they have the form of the<lb break="yes"/><hi rendition="#i">ponchos</hi> and <hi rendition="#i">ruanas</hi> of cotton, which are so<lb break="yes"/>common in New
                    Grenada, at Quito, and in<lb break="yes"/>Peru. As in these climates the riches and<lb break="yes"/>beneficence of
                    Nature are regarded as the<lb break="yes"/>primary causes of the indolence of the in-<lb break="no"/>habitants, the
                    missionaries do not fail to<lb break="yes"/>say in showing the shirts of <hi rendition="#i">marima</hi>, &#x2018;in the<lb break="yes"/>forests of the Oroonoko,
                    garments are found<lb break="yes"/>ready made on the trees.&#x2019; We may add to<lb break="yes"/>this tale of the shirts the pointed caps,<lb break="yes"/>which the spathes of certain palm-trees<lb break="yes"/>furnish, and which resemble coarse
                    net-<lb break="no"/>work.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;At the festival of which we were the spec-<lb break="no"/><cb/>tators, the women were excluded
                    from the<lb break="yes"/>dance, and every sort of public rejoicing;<lb break="yes"/>they were daily occupied in serving
                    the men<lb break="yes"/>with roasted monkey, fermented liquors,<lb break="yes"/>and palm cabbage. I mention this last<lb break="yes"/>production, which has the taste of our cau-<lb break="no"/>liflowers, because in no other country had<lb break="yes"/>we seen
                    specimens of such an immense size.<lb break="yes"/>The leaves that are not unfolded are con-<lb break="no"/>founded with
                    the young stem, and we mea-<lb break="no"/>sured cylinders of six feet long and five<lb break="yes"/>inches in
                    diameter. Another substance,<lb break="yes"/>which is much more nutritive, is obtained<lb break="yes"/>from the
                    animal kingdom: this is <hi rendition="#i">fish flour</hi>.<lb break="yes"/>The Indians in all the
                    Upper Oroonoko fry<lb break="yes"/>fish, dry them in the sun, and reduce them<lb break="yes"/>to powder without
                    separating the bones.<lb break="yes"/>I have seen masses of fifty or sixty pounds<lb break="yes"/>of this flour,
                    which resembles that of cas-<lb break="no"/>sava. When it is wanted for eating, it is<lb break="yes"/>mixed with
                    water, and reduced to a paste.<lb break="yes"/>In every climate the abundance of fish has<lb break="yes"/>led to the
                    invention of the same means of<lb break="yes"/>preserving them. Pliny and Diodorus Si-<lb break="no"/>culus have
                    described the <hi rendition="#i">fish bread</hi> of the<lb break="yes"/>ichthyophagous nations, that dwelt on the<lb break="yes"/>Persian
                    gulf, and the shores of the Red<lb break="yes"/>Sea.&#x201D;</p><p>(To be

            <p>THE
                following extract from our interest-<lb break="no"/>ing traveller refers to a subject of
                    much<lb break="yes"/>remarkable speculation:&#x2014;</p>
                <p>&#x201C;I shall here proceed to give some infor-<lb break="no"/>mation respecting the tribes of dwarf
                    and<lb break="yes"/>fair Indians, which ancient traditions placed<lb break="yes"/>for centuries near the sources of the
                    Oroo-<lb break="no"/>noko. I had an opportunity of seeing some<lb break="yes"/>of these Indians at Esmeralda, and can<lb break="yes"/>affirm, that the shortness of the Guaicas,<lb break="yes"/>and the fairness of the
                    Guahariboes, whom<lb break="yes"/>Father Caulin calls <hi rendition="#i">Guaribos blancos</hi>, have<lb break="yes"/>been alike exaggerated.
                    The Guaicas,<lb break="yes"/>whom I measured, were in general from<lb break="yes"/>four feet seven inches to four
                    feet eight<lb break="yes"/>inches high (ancienct measure of France).<lb break="yes"/>We were assured, that the whole tribe were<lb break="yes"/>of this extreme littleness;
                    but we must not<lb break="yes"/>forget, that what is called a tribe consti-<lb break="no"/>tutes, properly speaking,
                    but one family.<lb break="yes"/>The exclusion of all foreign mixture con-<lb break="no"/>tributes to perpetuate varieties, or the aber-<lb break="no"/>rations from a common standard. The In-<lb break="no"/>dians of
                    the lowest stature next to the<lb break="yes"/>Guaicas are the Guainares and the Poi-<lb break="no"/>gnaves. It is
                    singular, that all these nations<lb break="yes"/>are found close to the Caribbees, who are<lb break="yes"/>remarkably tall. They all inhabit the same<lb break="yes"/>climate, and subsist on the same
                    aliment.<lb break="yes"/>They are varieties in the race, which no<lb break="yes"/>doubt existed previously to the
                    settlement<lb break="yes"/>of these tribes, (tall and short, fair and dark<lb break="yes"/>brown) in the same
                    country. The four na-<lb break="no"/>tions of the Upper Oroonoko, that appeared<lb break="yes"/>to me to be the
                    fairest, are the Guahariboes<lb break="yes"/>of the Rio Gehette, the Guainares of the<lb break="yes"/>Ocamo, the
                    Guaicas of <hi rendition="#i">Canno</hi> Chiguire,<lb break="yes"/>and the Maquiritares of the sources of the<lb break="yes"/>Padamo, the
                    Jao, and the Ventuari. It<lb break="yes"/>being very striking to see natives with a fair<lb break="yes"/>skin
                    beneath a burning sky, and amid na-<lb break="no"/>tions of a very dark hue, the Spaniards<lb break="yes"/>have
                    forged two daring hypotheses, in order<lb break="yes"/>to explain this phenomenon. Some assert,<lb break="yes"/>that
                    the Dutch of Surinam and the Rio<lb break="yes"/>Esquibo may have intermingled with the<lb break="yes"/>Guahariboes
                    and the Guainares; others<lb break="yes"/>insist, from hatred to the Capuchins of the<lb break="yes"/>Carony, and
                    the Observantins of the Oroo-<lb break="no"/>noko, that the fair Indians are what are<lb break="yes"/>called in
                    Dalmatia <hi rendition="#i">muso di frate</hi>, children<lb break="yes"/>whose legitimacy is somewhat doubtful.<lb break="yes"/>In both
                    cases the <hi rendition="#i">Indios blancos</hi> would be<lb break="yes"/><cb/>mestizoes, sons of an Indian
                    woman and a<lb break="yes"/>white man. Now, having seen thousands<lb break="yes"/>of mestizoes, I can assert that
                    this com-<lb break="no"/>parison is altogether inaccurate. The in-<lb break="no"/>dividuals of the fair tribes, whom
                    we exa-<lb break="no"/>mined, have the features, the stature, and<lb break="yes"/>the smooth, straight, black hair,
                    which cha-<lb break="no"/>racterizes other Indians. It would be im-<lb break="no"/>possible to take them for a mixed
                    race, like<lb break="yes"/>the descendants of natives and Europeans.<lb break="yes"/>Some of these people are very
                    little, others<lb break="yes"/>of the ordinary stature of the copper-co-<lb break="no"/>loured Indians. They are
                    neither feeble,<lb break="yes"/>nor sickly, nor <hi rendition="#i">albinoes;</hi> and they differ<lb break="yes"/>from the
                    copper-coloured races only by a<lb break="yes"/>much less tawny skin.&#x201D; * * *</p>
                <p>&#x201C;These tribes with a fair complexion,<lb break="yes"/>which we had an opportunity of seeing at<lb break="yes"/>the
                    mission of Esmeralda, inhabit part of a<lb break="yes"/>mountainous country, that extends between<lb break="yes"/>the
                    sources of six tributary streams of the<lb break="yes"/>Oroonoko, the Padamo, the
                    Jao, the Ven-<lb break="no"/>tuari, the Erevato, the Aruy, and the Pa-<lb break="no"/>raguay. The Spanish and Portugueze mis-<lb break="no"/>sionaries have the custom of designating<lb break="yes"/>this
                    country more particularly by the name<lb break="yes"/>of <hi rendition="#i">Parima</hi>. Here, as in several other coun-<lb break="no"/>tries of Spanish America,
                    the savages have<lb break="yes"/>reconquered what had been wrested from<lb break="yes"/>them by civilization, or
                    rather by its pre-<lb break="no"/>cursors, the missionaries. The expedition<lb break="yes"/>of the boundaries under
                    Solano, and the<lb break="yes"/>extravagant zeal displayed by a governor of<lb break="yes"/>Guiana for the discovery
                    of Dorado, re-<lb break="no"/>vived in the latter half of the eighteenth<lb break="yes"/>century, in some individuals, that
                    spirit<lb break="yes"/>of enterprise, which characterized the Cas-<lb break="no"/>tilians at the period of the
                    discovery of<lb break="yes"/>America. In going along the Rio Padamo,<lb break="yes"/>a road was observed across the
                    forests and<lb break="yes"/>savannahs ten days journey long, from<lb break="yes"/>Esmeralda to the
                    sources of the Ventuari;<lb break="yes"/>and in two days more, from these sources,<lb break="yes"/>by the Erevato,
                    the missions on the Rio<lb break="yes"/>Caura were reached. Two intelligent and<lb break="yes"/>daring men,
                    don Antonio Santos and Cap-<lb break="no"/>tain Bareto, had established, with the aid<lb break="yes"/>of the
                    Maquiritares, a chain of military<lb break="yes"/>posts on this line from Esmeralda to the<lb break="yes"/>Rio
                    Erevato. They were houses of two<lb break="yes"/>stories <hi rendition="#i">(<choice><sic>cacas</sic><corr type="editorial">casas</corr></choice> fuertes)</hi>, mounted with
                    swivels,<lb break="yes"/>such as I have described above, which<lb break="yes"/>figured as nineteen villages on the maps<lb break="yes"/>published at Madrid. The soldiers, left to<lb break="yes"/>themselves,
                    exercised all kinds of vexations<lb break="yes"/>on the natives <hi rendition="#i">(Indians of peace),</hi> who had<lb break="yes"/>cultivated spots around the <hi rendition="#i"><choice><sic>cacas</sic><corr type="editorial">casas</corr></choice> fuertes;</hi><lb break="yes"/>and these vexations being less methodical,<lb break="yes"/>that is to say, worse contrived, than those<lb break="yes"/>to which the Indians are by degrees accus-<lb break="no"/>tomed in the missions, several tribes formed<lb break="yes"/>a league, in 1776, against the Spaniards.<lb break="yes"/>All the military
                    posts were attacked on the<lb break="yes"/>same night, on a line of nearly fifty leagues<lb break="yes"/>in length.
                    The houses were burnt, and<lb break="yes"/>many soldiers massacred; a very small<lb break="yes"/>number only owing
                    their preservation to the<lb break="yes"/>pity of the Indian women. This nocturnal<lb break="yes"/>expedition is
                    still mentioned with horror.<lb break="yes"/>Concerted in the deepest silence, it was<lb break="yes"/>executed with that concert, which the na-<lb break="no"/>tives of both Americas, skilful in
                    conceal-<lb break="no"/>ing their hostile passions, well know how to<lb break="yes"/>practise in whatever concerns
                    their common<lb break="yes"/><pb n="581" facs="#f0018"/>interests. Since 1776 no attempt has been<lb break="yes"/>made to re-establish the road,
                    which leads<lb break="yes"/>by land from the Upper to the Lower Oroo-<lb break="no"/>noko, and no white man has been
                    able to<lb break="yes"/>pass from Esmeralda to the Erevato.&#x201D;</p><p>In May, M. Humboldt and
                his compa-<lb break="no"/>nion left Esmeralda, and proceeded down<lb break="yes"/>the Oroonoko to the
                        point of bifurcation.<lb break="yes"/>Here, says the author, &#x201C;the cries of the<lb break="yes"/>jaguars<note place="foot" n="*">&#x201C;This frequency of large jaguars is

                        visible on the dark-brown<lb break="yes"/>ground of its skin. The Indians assert,<lb break="yes"/>that these tigers
                        are very rare, never mingle<lb break="yes"/>with the common jaguars, and &#x2018;form

                <p>Descending still farther down the Oroon-<lb break="no"/>oko, the travellers passed the rivers Cunu-<lb break="no"/>cunumo, Guanami, and Puruname. Here,<lb break="yes"/>as elsewhere in Guayana, rude figures, re-<lb break="no"/>presenting the sun, the moon, and various<lb break="yes"/>animals, are traced on the hardest rocks of<lb break="yes"/>granite, and attest the anterior existence of<lb break="yes"/>a people very different from those known to<lb break="yes"/>Europe as inhabitants of these parts.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The nations of the Tamanac race, the<lb break="yes"/>ancient inhabitants of those countries,
                    have<lb break="yes"/>a <hi rendition="#i">local</hi> mythology, and traditions which re-<lb break="no"/>late to these sculptured rocks.
                    <hi rendition="#i">Amalivaca</hi>,<lb break="yes"/>the father of the Tamanacs, that is, the<lb break="yes"/>creator of the human race, (for
                    every nation<lb break="yes"/>regards itself as the root of the other nations,)<lb break="yes"/> arrived in a bark at
                    the time of the great<lb break="yes"/>inundation, which is called <hi rendition="#i">the age of water</hi>,<lb break="yes"/>when the
                    billows of the ocean broke against<lb break="yes"/>the mountains of Encamarada in the interior<lb break="yes"/>of
                    the land. All mankind, or, to express<lb break="yes"/>myself better, all the Tamanacs, were
                    drown-<lb break="no"/>ed, with the exception of one man and one<lb break="yes"/>woman, who saved themselves on a
                    moun-<lb break="no"/>tain near the banks of the Asiveru, called<lb break="yes"/>Cuchivero by the Spaniards. This
                    moun-<lb break="no"/>tain is the Ararat of the Aramean or Semitic<lb break="yes"/>nations, and the Tlaloc or
                    Colhuacan of the<lb break="yes"/>Mexicans. <hi rendition="#i">Amalivaca</hi>, sailing in his bark,<lb break="yes"/>engraved the figures of
                    the moon and the<lb break="yes"/>sun on the <hi rendition="#i">Painted rock (Tepumereme)</hi> of<lb break="yes"/>Encaramada. Some blocks of
                    granite piled<lb break="yes"/><cb/>upon one another, and forming a kind of<lb break="yes"/>cavern, are still called the
                    <hi rendition="#i">house</hi> or <hi rendition="#i">dwelling</hi><lb break="yes"/>of the great forefather of the Tamanacs.<lb break="yes"/>The natives show also a
                    large stone near<lb break="yes"/>this cavern, in the plains of Maita, which<lb break="yes"/>they say was an
                    instrument of music, the<lb break="yes"/><hi rendition="#i">drum of Amalivaca</hi>. We must here observe,<lb break="yes"/>that this heroic
                    personage had a brother,<lb break="yes"/><hi rendition="#i">Vochi</hi>, who helped him to give the surface<lb break="yes"/>of the earth its
                    present form. The Tama-<lb break="no"/>nacs relate, that the two brothers, in their<lb break="yes"/>system of
                    perfectibility, sought at first to<lb break="yes"/>arrange the Oroonoko in such a manner,<lb break="yes"/>that the
                    current of the water could always<lb break="yes"/>be followed either going down or going up<lb break="yes"/>the
                    river. They hoped by this means to<lb break="yes"/>spare men the trouble of rowing in proceed-<lb break="no"/>ing toward the source of rivers; but,
                    how-<lb break="no"/>ever great the power of these regenerators<lb break="yes"/>of the world, they could never
                    contrive to<lb break="yes"/>give a double slope to the Oroonoko, and<lb break="yes"/>were compelled to relinquish
                    this singular<lb break="yes"/>plan. Amalivaca had daugh-<lb break="no"/>ters, who had a decided taste for travelling.<lb break="yes"/>The tradition says, no doubt in a figurative<lb break="yes"/>style, that he broke their legs,
                    to render<lb break="yes"/>them sedentary, and force them to people<lb break="yes"/>the land of the Tamanacs. After
                    having<lb break="yes"/>regulated every thing in America, on that<lb break="yes"/>side of the <hi rendition="#i">great water</hi>, Amalivaca
                    again<lb break="yes"/>embarked, and &#x2018;returned to the other shore,&#x2019;<lb break="yes"/>to the same place from which he
                    came.<lb break="yes"/>Since the natives have seen the Missionaries<lb break="yes"/>arrive, they imagine, that Europe
                    is this<lb break="yes"/><hi rendition="#i">other shore;</hi> and one of them inquired with<lb break="yes"/>great simplicity of father Gili,
                    whether he<lb break="yes"/>had seen the great Amalivaca <hi rendition="#i">yonder</hi>, the<lb break="yes"/>father of the Tamanacs, who had
                    covered<lb break="yes"/>the rocks with symbolic figures.&#x201D;</p><p>Still lower down the great river, M. Hum-<lb break="no"/>boldt visited the cavern of Ataruipe, of<lb break="yes"/>which
                    he gives the following curious ac-<lb break="no"/>count:&#x2014;</p>
                <p>&#x201C;We soon reckoned in this tomb of a<lb break="yes"/>whole extinct tribe near six hundred ske-<lb break="no"/>letons well preserved, and so regularly<lb break="yes"/>placed, that it would have been difficult to<lb break="yes"/>make an error in their number. Ever<lb break="yes"/>skeleton reposes in a sort of basket, made<lb break="yes"/>of the petioles of the palm-tree. These<lb break="yes"/>baskets, which the natives call <hi rendition="#i">mapires</hi>, have<lb break="yes"/>the form of a square bag. Their size is<lb break="yes"/>proportioned to the age of the dead; there<lb break="yes"/>are some for infants cut off at the moment<lb break="yes"/>of their birth. We saw them from ten<lb break="yes"/>inches to three feet four inches long, the<lb break="yes"/>skeletons in them being bent together.<lb break="yes"/>They are all ranged near each other, and<lb break="yes"/>are so entire, that not a rib or a phalanx is<lb break="yes"/>wanting. The bones have been prepared<lb break="yes"/>in three different manners, either whitened<lb break="yes"/>in the air and the sun; dyed red with<lb break="yes"/>onoto, a coloring matter extracted from<lb break="yes"/>the bixa orellana; or, like real mummies,<lb break="yes"/>varnished with odoriferous resins, and en-<lb break="no"/>veloped in leaves of the heliconia or of the<lb break="yes"/>plantain tree. The Indians related to us,<lb break="yes"/>that the fresh corpse is placed in damp<lb break="yes"/>ground, in order that the flesh may be con-<lb break="no"/>sumed by degrees; some months after, it is<lb break="yes"/>taken out, and the flesh remaining on the<lb break="yes"/>bones is scraped off with sharp stones.<lb break="yes"/>Several hordes in Guyana still observe this custom.<lb break="yes"/>Earthen vases half-baked are found<lb break="yes"/><cb/>near the <hi rendition="#i">mapires</hi>, or baskets. They appear<lb break="yes"/>to contain the bones of the same family.<lb break="yes"/>The largest of these vases, or funeral urns,<lb break="yes"/>are three feet high, and five feet and a half<lb break="yes"/>long. Their color is greenish gray; and<lb break="yes"/>their oval form is sufficiently pleasing to the<lb break="yes"/>eye. The handles are made in the shape of<lb break="yes"/>crocodiles, or serpents; the edge is bor-<lb break="no"/>dered with meanders, labyrinths, and real<lb break="yes"/><hi rendition="#i">grecques</hi>, in straight lines variously com-<lb break="no"/>bined. Such paintings are found in every<lb break="yes"/>zone, among nations the most remote from<lb break="yes"/>each other, either with respect to the spot<lb break="yes"/>which they occupy on the globe, or to the<lb break="yes"/>degree of civilization which they have at-<lb break="no"/>tained. The inhabitants of the little mis-<lb break="no"/>sion of Maypures still execute them on<lb break="yes"/>their commonest pottery; they decorate the<lb break="yes"/>bucklers of the Otaheiteans, the fishing im-<lb break="no"/>plements of the Eskimoes, the walls of the<lb break="yes"/>Mexican palace of Mitla, and the vases of<lb break="yes"/>ancient Greece. Every where a rhythmic<lb break="yes"/>repetition of the same forms flatters the<lb break="yes"/>eye, as the cadensed repetition of sounds<lb break="yes"/>soothes the ear. Analogies founded on the<lb break="yes"/>internal nature of our feelings, on the natu-<lb break="no"/>ral dispositions of our intellect, are not cal-<lb break="no"/>culated to throw light on the filiation and<lb break="yes"/>the ancient connections of nations.</p><p>&#x201C;We could not acquire any precise idea of<lb break="yes"/>the period to which the origin of the <hi rendition="#i">mapires</hi><lb break="yes"/>and the painted vases, contained in the os-<lb break="no"/>suary cavern of Ataruipe, can be traced.<lb break="yes"/>The greater part seemed not to be more than<lb break="yes"/>a century old; but it may be supposed, that,<lb break="yes"/>sheltered from all humidity, under the in-<lb break="no"/>fluence of a uniform temperature, the pre-<lb break="no"/>servation of these articles would be no less<lb break="yes"/>perfect, if it dated from a period far more<lb break="yes"/>remote. A tradition circulates among the<lb break="yes"/>Guahiboes, that the warlike Atures, pursued<lb break="yes"/>by the Caribbees, escaped to the rocks that<lb break="yes"/>rise in the middle of the Great Cataracts;<lb break="yes"/>and there that nation, heretofore so numer-<lb break="no"/>ous, became gradually extinct, as well as its<lb break="yes"/>language. The last families of the Atures<lb break="yes"/>still existed in 1767, in the time of the mis-<lb break="no"/>sionary Gili. At the period of our voyage<lb break="yes"/>an old parrot was shown at Maypures, of<lb break="yes"/>which the inhabitants related, and the fact<lb break="yes"/>is worthy of observation, that &#x2018;they did not<lb break="yes"/>understand what it said, because it spoke<lb break="yes"/>the language of the Atures.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x201C;We opened, to the great concern of our<lb break="yes"/>guides, several <hi rendition="#i">mapires</hi>, in order to examine<lb break="yes"/>attentively the form of the sculls; they all<lb break="yes"/>displayed the characteristics of the Ame-<lb break="no"/>rican race, with the exception of two or<lb break="yes"/>three, which approached indubitably to the<lb break="yes"/>Caucasian.&#x201D; * * * *</p> <p>&#x201C;We took several sculls, the skeleton of<lb break="yes"/>a child of six or seven years old, and two of<lb break="yes"/>full-grown men of the nation of the Atures,<lb break="yes"/>from the cavern of Ataruipe. All these<lb break="yes"/>bones, partly painted red, partly varnished<lb break="yes"/>with odoriferous resins, were placed in the<lb break="yes"/>baskets <hi rendition="#i">(mapires</hi> or <hi rendition="#i">canastos),</hi> which we have<lb break="yes"/>just described. They made almost the<lb break="yes"/>whole load of a mule; and as we knew the<lb break="yes"/>superstitious aversion of the Indians for<lb break="yes"/>dead bodies, when they have given them<lb break="yes"/>sepulture, we had carefully enveloped the<lb break="yes"/><hi rendition="#i">canastos</hi> in mats recently woven. Unfortu-<lb break="no"/>nately for us, the penetration of the Indians,<lb break="yes"/><pb n="582" facs="#f0019"/>and the extreme quickness of their senses,<lb break="yes"/>rendered all our precautions useless. Wher-<lb break="no"/>ever we stopped, in the missions of the<lb break="yes"/>Caribbees, amid the Llanos, between An-<lb break="no"/>gostura and Nueva Barcelona, the natives<lb break="yes"/>assembled round our mules to admire the<lb break="yes"/>monkeys which we had purchased at the<lb break="yes"/>Oroonoko. These good people had scarcely<lb break="yes"/>touched our baggage, when they announced<lb break="yes"/>the approaching death of the beast of burden,<lb break="yes"/>&#x2018;that carried the dead.&#x2019; In vain we told<lb break="yes"/>them that they were deceived in their con-<lb break="no"/>jectures, and that the baskets contained the bones<lb break="yes"/>of crocodiles and manatees; they per-<lb break="no"/>sisted in repeating, that they smelt the re-<lb break="no"/>sin, that surrounded the skeletons, and<lb break="yes"/>&#x2018;that they were their <hi rendition="#i">old relations</hi>.&#x2019; We<lb break="yes"/>were obliged to make the monks interpose<lb break="yes"/>their authority, in order to conquer the<lb break="yes"/>aversion of the natives, and procure for us a<lb break="yes"/>change of mules.</p><p>&#x201C;One of the sculls, which we took from<lb break="yes"/>the cavern of Ataruipe, has appeared in the<lb break="yes"/>fine work published by my old master, Blu-<lb break="no"/>menbach, on the varieties of the human<lb break="yes"/>species. The skeletons of the Indians were<lb break="yes"/>lost on the coast of Africa, together with a<lb break="yes"/>considerable part of our collections, in a<lb break="yes"/>shipwreck, in which perished our friend<lb break="yes"/>and fellow-traveller, Fray Juan Gonzales, a<lb break="yes"/>young monk of the order of St. Francis.</p><p>&#x201C;We withdrew in silence from the cavern<lb break="yes"/>of Ataruipe. It was one of those calm and<lb break="yes"/>serene
                    nights, which are so common in the<lb break="yes"/>torrid zone. The stars shone with a mild<lb break="yes"/>and
                    planetary light. Their scintillation was<lb break="yes"/>scarcely sensible at the horizon, which<lb break="yes"/>seemed illumined by the great nebul&#x00E6; of the<lb break="yes"/>southern hemisphere. An
                    innumerable mul-<lb break="no"/>titude of insects spread a reddish light on<lb break="yes"/>the ground, loaded
                    with plants, and re-<lb break="no"/>splendent with these living and moving<lb break="yes"/>fires, as if the stars
                    of the firmament had<lb break="yes"/>sunk down on the savannah. On quitting<lb break="yes"/>the cavern, we
                    stopped several times to ad-<lb break="no"/>mire the beauty of this singular scene. The<lb break="yes"/>odoriferous vanilla, and festoons of bigno-<lb break="no"/>nia, decorated the entrance; and
                    above, on<lb break="yes"/>the summit of the hill, the arrowy branches<lb break="yes"/>of the palm-trees waved
                    murmuring in<lb break="yes"/>the air.&#x201D;<lb break="yes"/></p>

                    monte,</hi>) have a de-<lb break="no"/>cided aversion to cultivate the land, and<lb break="yes"/>live almost exclusively on hunting and
                    fish-<lb break="no"/>ing. They are men of very robust con-<lb break="no"/>stitution; but ugly,
                    savage, vindictive, and<lb break="yes"/>passionately fond of fermented liquors.<lb break="yes"/>They are omnivorous <hi rendition="#i"
                        >animals</hi> in the highest<lb break="yes"/>degree; and therefore the other
                    Indians,<lb break="yes"/>who consider them as barbarians, have a<lb break="yes"/>common saying, &#x2018;nothing is so disgusting<lb break="yes"/>that an
                    Otomac will not eat it.&#x2019; While the<lb break="yes"/>waters of the Oroonoko
                    and its tributary<lb break="yes"/>streams are low, the Otomacs subsist on<lb break="yes"/>fish and turtles. The former they kill with<lb break="yes"/>surprising dexterity, by shooting them with<lb break="yes"/>an arrow, when they appear at the surface<lb break="yes"/>of the water.
                    When the rivers swell, which<lb break="yes"/>in South America, as well as in
                    Egypt and<lb break="yes"/>in Nubia, is erroneously attributed to the<lb break="yes"/>melting of the snows, and which occurs<lb break="yes"/>periodically in
                    every part of the torrid zone,<lb break="yes"/>fishing almost entirely ceases. It is then<lb break="yes"/>as difficult to procure
                    fish in the rivers<lb break="yes"/>which are become deeper, as when you are<lb break="yes"/>sailing on the open sea. It often fails the<lb break="yes"/>poor missionaries, on
                    fast-days as well as<lb break="yes"/>flesh-days, though all the young Indians are<lb break="yes"/>under the obligation of &#x2018;fishing for the con-<lb break="no"/>vent.&#x2019; At the period of these inundations,<lb break="yes"/>which
                    last two or three months, the Oto-<lb break="no"/>macs swallow a prodigious quantity of<lb break="yes"/>earth. We found heaps of balls
                    in their<lb break="yes"/>huts, piled up in pyramids three or four feet<lb break="yes"/>high.
                    These balls were five or six inches<lb break="yes"/>in diameter. The earth which the Otomacs<lb break="yes"/>eat is a very fine and
                    unctuous clay, of a<lb break="yes"/>yellowish grey colour; and, being slightly<lb break="yes"/>baked in the fire, the hardened crust has a<lb break="yes"/>tint inclining to red, owing to the oxid of<lb break="yes"/>iron which is
                    mingled with it. We brought<lb break="yes"/>away some of this earth, which we took<lb break="yes"/>from the winter provision of the
                    Indians;<lb break="yes"/>and it is absolutely false, that it is steatitic,<lb break="yes"/>and
                    contains magnesia. Mr. Vauquelin<lb break="yes"/>did not discover any traces of this earth in<lb break="yes"/>it; but he found that it
                    contained more<lb break="yes"/>silex than alumin, and three or four per<lb break="yes"/>cent of
                    lime.</p>
                 
                <p>&#x201C;The Otomacs do not eat every kind of<lb break="yes"/>clay indifferently; they choose the alluvial<lb break="yes"/>beds or strata that contain the most unctuous<lb break="yes"/>earth, and the smoothest to
                    the feel. I in-<lb break="no"/>quired of the missionary, whether the moist-<lb break="no"/>ened clay were made to undergo, as Father<lb break="yes"/>Gumilla asserts, that peculiar decomposi-<lb break="no"/>tion, which is
                    indicated by a disengagement<lb break="yes"/>of carbonic acid and sulphuretted hydrogen,<lb break="yes"/>and which is designated in
                    every language<lb break="yes"/>by the term of <hi rendition="#i"
                        >putrefaction;</hi> but he assured<lb break="yes"/>us, that the natives
                    neither cause the 
                    <hi rendition="#i">clay</hi><lb break="yes"/><cb/>to <hi rendition="#i">rot,</hi> nor do they mingle
                    it with flour of<lb break="yes"/>maize, oil of turtles&#x2019; eggs, or fat of the cro-<lb break="no"/>codile. We ourselves examined, both
                    at<lb break="yes"/>the Oroonoko and after our return to Paris,<lb break="yes"/>the balls of earth which we brought away<lb break="yes"/>with us, and found no trace of the mixture<lb break="yes"/>of any organic substance, whether oily
                    or<lb break="yes"/>farinaceous. The savage regards every<lb break="yes"/>thing as nourishing that appeases hunger;<lb break="yes"/>when, therefore,
                    you inquire of an Otomac<lb break="yes"/>on what he subsists during the two
                    months<lb break="yes"/>when the river is the highest, he shows you<lb break="yes"/>his balls of clayey earth. This he calls
                    his<lb break="yes"/>principal food; for all this period he can<lb break="yes"/>seldom procure a
                    lizard, a root of fern,<lb break="yes"/>or a dead fish swimming at the surface of<lb break="yes"/>the water. If the Indian eat
                    earth from want<lb break="yes"/>during two months, (and from three quar-<lb break="no"/>ters to
                    five quarters of a pound in twenty-<lb break="hyph-yes"/>four hours,) he does not the less regale him-<lb break="no"/>self with it during the rest of
                    the year.<lb break="yes"/>Every day in the season of drought, when<lb break="yes"/>fishing is most abundant, he scrapes his<lb break="yes"/>balls of
                    <hi rendition="#i">poya,</hi> and mingles a little clay with<lb break="yes"/>his other aliment. What is most surprising<lb break="yes"/>is, that the Otomacs
                    do not become lean by<lb break="yes"/>swallowing such quantities of earth; they<lb break="yes"/>are, on the contrary, extremely robust,
                    and<lb break="yes"/>far from having the belly tense and puffed<lb break="yes"/>up. The missionary Fray Ramon Bueno<lb break="yes"/>asserts, that he
                    never remarked any altera-<lb break="no"/>tion in the health of the natives at the pe-<lb break="no"/>riod of the great risings of the Oroonoko.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;The following are the facts in all their<lb break="yes"/>simplicity,
                    which we were able to verify.<lb break="yes"/>The Otomacs during some months, eat<lb break="yes"/>daily three quarters of a pound of
                    clay<lb break="yes"/>slightly hardened by fire, without their health<lb break="yes"/>being
                    sensibly affected by it. They moisten<lb break="yes"/>the earth afresh when they are going to<lb break="yes"/>swallow it. It
                    has not been possible to<lb break="yes"/>verify hitherto with precision how much<lb break="yes"/>nutritious vegetable or animal matter<lb break="yes"/>the Indians take in a week at the same<lb break="yes"/>time; but it is certain
                    that they attri-<lb break="no"/>bute the sensation of satiety which they<lb break="yes"/>feel, to the clay, and not to the wretched<lb break="yes"/>aliments which
                    they take with it occa-<lb break="no"/>sionally. No physiological phenomenon<lb break="yes"/>being entirely insulated, it may be
                    interest-<lb break="no"/>ing to examine several analogous pheno-<lb break="no"/>mena, which I
                        have been able to collect.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;I observed every where within the<lb break="yes"/>torrid zone, in a great
                    number of indivi-<lb break="no"/>duals, children, women, and sometimes<lb break="yes"/>even full-grown men, an inordinate and<lb break="yes"/>almost
                    irresistible desire of swallowing<lb break="yes"/>earth; not an alkaline or calcareous earth,<lb break="yes"/>to neutralize (as it is vulgarly said) acid<lb break="yes"/>juices, but a fat clay, unctuous, and
                    exhal-<lb break="no"/>ing a strong smell. It is often found ne-<lb break="no"/>cessary to tie
                    the childrens&#x2019; hands, or to<lb break="yes"/>confine them, to prevent their eating earth,<lb break="yes"/>when the rain ceases
                    to fall. At the village<lb break="yes"/>of Banco, on the bank of the river
                    Magda-<lb break="no"/>lena, I saw the Indian women who make<lb break="yes"/>pottery continually swallowing great pieces<lb break="yes"/>of clay.&#x201D;</p>
                 
                <p>The author goes at some length into<lb break="yes"/>analogies and reasoning on
                    them, but we<lb break="yes"/>confine our quotation principally to the<lb break="yes"/>facts.</p>
                 
                <p>&#x201C;The negroes on the coast of Guinea de-<lb break="no"/>light in eating a yellowish earth, which they<lb break="yes"/><cb/>call <hi rendition="#i">caouac.</hi>
                    The slaves who are taken to<lb break="yes"/>America try to procure for themselves the<lb break="yes"/>same enjoyment; but it is
                    constantly detri-<lb break="no"/>mental to their health. They say, &#x2018;that<lb break="yes"/>the earth of the West Indies is not so easy<lb break="yes"/>of digestion as
                    that of their country.&#x2019;&#x201D;<lb break="yes"/>* * * * *</p>
                 
                <p>&#x201C;In the Indian Archipelago, at the<lb break="yes"/>island of Java, Mr.
                    Labillardière saw, be-<lb break="no"/>tween Surabaya and Samarang, little square<lb break="yes"/>and reddish cakes exposed to sale. These<lb break="yes"/>cakes, called <hi rendition="#i">tanaampo,</hi>
                    were cakes of clay,<lb break="yes"/>slightly baked, which the

                    has a pe-<lb break="no"/>culiar taste, which is owing to the torrefac-<lb break="no"/>tion; it is
                    very absorbent, and adheres<lb break="yes"/>to the tongue, which it dries. In general<lb break="yes"/>it is only the Javanese

                    lose their appetite im-<lb break="no"/>perceptibly, and no longer take without<lb break="yes"/>disgust a very small quantity of food:

                    the crocodiles of the Oroonoko.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;When the waters (says Mr. H.) are<lb break="yes"/>high, the river
                    inundates the keys; and it<lb break="yes"/>sometimes happens, that even in the
                        town<lb break="yes"/>imprudent men become the prey of croco-<lb break="no"
                    />diles. I shall transcribe from my journal a<lb break="yes"/>fact, that took
                    place during Mr. Bonpland&#x2019;s<lb break="yes"/>illness. A Guaykeri Indian,
                    from the island<lb break="yes"/>de la Margaretta, went to anchor his canoe<lb
                        break="yes"/>in a cove, where there were not three feet<lb break="yes"/>of
                    water. A very fierce crocodile, that ha-<lb break="no"/>bitually haunted that
                    spot, seized him by<lb break="yes"/>the leg, and withdrew from the shore, re-<lb
                        break="no"/>maining on the surface of the water. The<lb break="yes"
                    /><cb/>cries of the Indian drew together a crowd<lb break="yes"/>of spectators.
                    This unfortunate man was<lb break="yes"/>first seen seeking with astonishing
                        courage<lb break="yes"/>for a knife in the pocket of his pantaloons.<lb
                        break="yes"/>Not being able to find it, he seized the head<lb break="yes"
                    />of the crocodile, and thrust his fingers into<lb break="yes"/>its eyes. No man
                    in the hot regions of<lb break="yes"/>America is ignorant, that this
                        carnivorous<lb break="yes"/>reptile, covered with a buckler of hard and<lb
                        break="yes"/>dry scales, is extremely sensible in the only<lb break="yes"
                    />parts of his body which are soft and unpro-<lb break="no"/>tected, such as the
                    eyes, the hollow under-<lb break="no"/>neath the shoulders, the nostrils, and
                        be-<lb break="no"/>neath the lower jaw, where there are two<lb break="yes"
                    />glands of musk. The Guaykeri Indian had<lb break="yes"/>recourse to the same
                    means which saved<lb break="yes"/>the negro of Mungo Park, and the girl of<lb
                        break="yes"/>Uritucu, whom I have mentioned above;<lb break="yes"/>but he
                    was less fortunate than they had<lb break="yes"/>been, for the crocodile did not
                    open its<lb break="yes"/>jaws, and lose hold of its prey. The ani-<lb break="no"
                    />mal, yielding to the pain, plunged to the<lb break="yes"/>bottom of the river;
                    and, after having<lb break="yes"/>drowned the Indian, came up to the surface<lb
                        break="yes"/>of the water, dragging the dead body to an<lb break="yes"
                    />island opposite the port. I arrived at the<lb break="yes"/>moment when a great
                    number of the inha-<lb break="no"/>bitants of Angostura had witnessed this
                        me-<lb break="no"/>lancholy spectacle.</p>
                <p>&#x201C;As the crocodile, on account of the<lb break="yes"/>structure of its
                    larynx, of the hyoid bone,<lb break="yes"/>and of the folds of its tongue, can
                        seize,<lb break="yes"/>though not swallow, its prey under water;<lb
                        break="yes"/>a man seldom disappears without the ani-<lb break="no"/>mal
                    being perceived some hours after near<lb break="yes"/>the spot where the
                    misfortune has happened,<lb break="yes"/>devouring its prey on a neighbouring
                        beach.<lb break="yes"/>The number of individuals who perish an-<lb
                        break="no"/>nually, the victims of their own imprudence<lb break="yes"/>and
                    of the ferocity of these reptiles, is much<lb break="yes"/>greater than it is
                    believed to be in Europe.<lb break="yes"/>It is particularly so in villages,
                    where the <lb break="yes"/>neighbouring grounds are often inundated.<lb
                        break="yes"/>The same crocodiles remain long in the<lb break="yes"/>same
                    places. They become from year to<lb break="yes"/>year more daring, especially,
                    as the Indians<lb break="yes"/>assert, if they have once tasted of human<lb
                        break="yes"/>flesh. These animals are so wary, that they<lb break="yes"/>are
                    killed with difficulty. A ball does not<lb break="yes"/>pierce their skin, and
                    the shot is only mor-<lb break="no"/>tal when directed at the throat, or
                        beneath<lb break="yes"/>the shoulder. The Indians, who know<lb break="yes"
                    />little of the use of fire-arms, attack the cro-<lb break="no"/>codile with
                    lances, after it is caught with<lb break="yes"/>large pointed iron hooks, baited
                    with pieces<lb break="yes"/>of meat, and fastened by a chain to the<lb
                        break="yes"/>trunk of a tree. They do not approach the<lb break="yes"
                    />animal till it has struggled a long time to<lb break="yes"/>disengage itself
                    from the iron fixed in the<lb break="yes"/>upper jaw. There is little
                    probability that<lb break="yes"/>a country in which a labyrinth of rivers<lb
                        break="yes"/>without number brings every day new bands<lb break="yes"/>of
                    crocodiles from the eastern back of the<lb break="yes"/>Andes, by the Meta and
                    the Apure, towards<lb break="yes"/>the coast of Spanish Guyana, should ever<lb
                        break="yes"/>be delivered from these reptiles. All that<lb break="yes"/>will
                    be gained by civilization will be, to<lb break="yes"/>render them more timid,
                    and more easily<lb break="yes"/>put to flight.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>&#x201C;Affecting instances are related of Afri-<lb break="no"/>can slaves, who
                    have exposed their lives<lb break="yes"/>to save those of their masters, who
                        had<lb break="yes"/>fallen into the jaws of the crocodile. A few<lb
                        break="yes"/>years ago, between Uritucu and the <hi rendition="#i"

                    <cb/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">de Abaxo,</hi> a negro, hearing the cries of his<lb
                        break="yes"/>master, flew to the spot, armed with a long<lb break="yes"
                    />knife, <hi rendition="#i">(machette,)</hi> and plunged into the<lb break="yes"
                    />river. He forced the crocodile, by putting<lb break="yes"/>out his eyes, to
                    let go his prey, and hide<lb break="yes"/>himself under the water. The slave
                        bore<lb break="yes"/>his expiring master to the shore, but all<lb
                        break="yes"/>succour was unavailing to restore him to<lb break="yes"/>life.
                    He died of suffocation, for his wounds<lb break="yes"/>were not deep; the
                    crocodile, like the<lb break="yes"/>dog, appears not to close its jaws firmly<lb
                        break="yes"/>while swimming. It is almost superfluous<lb break="yes"/>to
                    add, that the children of the deceased,<lb break="yes"/>though poor, gave the
                    slave his freedom.&#x201D;</p>
