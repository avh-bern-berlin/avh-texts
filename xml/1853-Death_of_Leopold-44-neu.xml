<div n="1"><head><hi rendition="#k">Von Buch,</hi> the eminent geologist.</head><lb/><p>The following is a letter from Humboldt to<lb/>Sir R. I. Murchison, announcing his death, (<hi rendition="#i">Athen&#x0153;um</hi>, No. 1924.)&#x2014;&#x201C;That<lb/>I should be destined&#x2014;I, an old man of eighty-three&#x2014;to announce to you,<lb/>dear Sir Roderick, the saddest news that I could have to convey&#x2014;to you<lb/>for whom M. De Buch professed a friendship so tender, and to the many<lb/>admirers of his genius, his vast labours, and his noble character! Leopold<lb/>De Buch was taken from us this morning by typhoid fever, so violent in its<lb/>attack that two days only of danger warned us. He was at my house so<lb/>lately as the 26th [ult.] despite the snow and the distance between us, talking<lb/>geology with the most lively interest. That evening he went into society;<lb/>and on Sunday and Monday (the 27th and 28th) he complained of a feverish<lb/>attack, which he believed to be caused by a large chilblain swelling from<lb/>which he had suffered for years. The inflammation required the application<lb/>of leeches, but the pain and the fever increased. He was speechless for<lb/>forty-eight hours. ** He died surrounded by his friends,&#x2014;most of whom<lb/>knew nothing of his danger till Wednesday evening, the 2nd of March.&#x201D;</p></div><lb/></body><back></back>
