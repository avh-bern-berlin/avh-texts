<div n="1"><head>THE UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD OF<lb/>MAN.</head><lb/><p><hi rendition="#k">While</hi> we maintain the unity of the human<lb/>species, we at the same time
                    repel the depress-<lb/>ing assumption of superior and inferior races of<lb/>men.
                    There are nations more susceptible of<lb/>cultivation, more highly civilized,
                    more enno-<lb/>bled by mental cultivation, than others; but<lb/>none in
                    themselves nobler than others. All<lb/>are, in like degree, designed for
                    freedom&#x2014;a free-<lb/>dom which, in the ruder conditions of
                    society,<lb/>belongs only to the individual; but which, in<lb/>social states,
                    enjoying political institutions, ap-<lb/>pertains as a right to the whole body
                    of the<lb/>community. If we would indicate an idea which,<lb/>throughout the
                    whole course of history, has ever<lb/>more and more widely extended its empire;
                    or<lb/>which, more than any other, testifies to the<lb/>much contested and more
                    misunderstood per-<lb/><cb/>fectibility of the whole human race; it is
                    that<lb/>of establishing our common humanity&#x2014;of striv-<lb/>ing to remove
                    the barriers which prejudice and<lb/>limited views of every kind have erected
                    among<lb/>men; and to treat all mankind, without refe-<lb/>rence to religion,
                    nation, or colour, as one fra-<lb/>ternity, one great communion, fitted for
                    the<lb/>attainment of one object&#x2014;the unrestrained de-<lb/>velopment of
                    the physical powers. This is the<lb/>ultimate and highest aim of society,
                    identical<lb/>with the direction implanted by nature in the<lb/>mind of man
                    towards the indefinite extension of<lb/>his existence. He regards the earth in
                    all its<lb/>limits, and the heavens, as far as his eye can<lb/>scan their bright
                    and starry depths, as inwardly<lb/>his own; given to him as objects for
                    contempla-<lb/>tion, and as a field for the development of his<lb/>energies.
                    Even the child longs to pass the hills<lb/>or the seas which enclose his narrow
                    home; yet<lb/>when his eager steps have borne him beyond<lb/>those limits, he
                    pines, like the plant, for his na-<lb/>tive soil; and it is by this touching and
                    beau-<lb/>tiful attribute of man,&#x2014;this longing for that<lb/>which is
                    unknown, and this fond remembrance<lb/>of that which is lost&#x2014;that he is
                    spared from an<lb/>exclusive attachment to the present. Thus<lb/>deeply rooted
                    in the innermost nature of man,<lb/>and even enjoined upon him by his highest
                    ten-<lb/>dencies, the recognition of the bond of humanity<lb/>becomes one of the
                    noblest leading principles in<lb/>the history of mankind. &#x2014; <hi
