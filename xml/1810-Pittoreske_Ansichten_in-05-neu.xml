                <p>There is no proof, that the existence<lb break="yes"/>of man is much more recent in Ame-<lb break="no"/>rica than in the other continent.<lb break="yes"/>Within the tropics, the strength of<lb break="yes"/>vegetation, the breadth of rivers, and<lb break="yes"/>partial inundations have presented<lb break="yes" />powerful obstacles to the migration of<lb break="yes"/>nations. The extensive countries of<lb break="yes"/>the north of Asia are as thinly peopled<lb break="yes"/>as the savannahs of New Mexico and<lb break="yes"/>Paraguay; nor is it necessary to sup-<lb break="no"/>pose, that the countries first peopled<lb break="yes"/>are those, which offer the greatest mass<lb break="yes"/>of inhabitants. The problem of the<lb break="yes"/>first population of America, is no more<lb break="yes"/>the province of history, than the ques-<lb break="no"/>tions on the origin of plants and ani-<lb break="no" />mals, and on the distribution of or-<lb break="no"/>ganic germs, are that of natural<lb break="yes"/>science. History, in carrying us back<lb break="yes" />to the earliest epochas, instructs us<lb break="yes"/>that almost every part of the globe is<lb break="yes"/>occupied by men who think themselves<lb break="yes"/>aborigines, because they are ignorant<lb break="yes"/>of their origin. Among a multitude<lb break="yes"/>of nations, who have succeeded, or<lb break="yes"/>have been incorporated with each other,<lb break="yes"/>it is impossible to discover with pre-<lb break="no"/>cision, the first basis of population,<lb break="yes"/>that primitive stratum beyond which<lb break="yes"/>the region of cosmogonical tradition<lb break="yes" />begins.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The nations of America, except<lb break="yes"/>those which border on the polar circle,<lb break="yes"/>form a single race, characterized by<lb break="yes" />the formation of the scull, the colour<lb break="yes"/>of the skin, the extreme thinness of<lb break="yes"/>the beard, and straight and glossy hair.<lb break="yes"/>The American race bears a very striking<lb break="yes" />resemblance to that of the Mongul<lb break="yes"/>nations, which include the descendants<lb break="yes"/>of the Hiong-Nu, known heretofore<lb break="yes" />by the name of Huns, the Kalkas, the<lb break="yes"/>Kalmucks, and the Burats. It has been<lb break="yes"/>ascertained, by late observations, that<lb break="yes"/>not only the inhabitants of Unalashka,<lb break="yes"/>but several tribes of South America,<lb break="yes"/>indicate, by the osteological characters<lb break="yes"/>of the head, a passage from the Ame-<lb break="no"/>
                    <cb/>rican to the Mongul race. When we<lb break="yes"/>shall have more completely studied the<lb break="yes"/>brown men of Africa; and that swarm<lb break="yes"/>of nations, who inhabit the interior<lb break="yes"/>and north-east of Asia, and who are<lb break="yes"/>vaguely described by systematic tra-<lb break="no"/>vellers under the name of Tartars and<lb break="yes" />Tschoudes, the Caucasian, Mongul,<lb break="yes"/>American, Malay, and Negro races,<lb break="yes"/>will appear less insulated, and we shall<lb break="yes"/>acknowledge, in this great family of<lb break="yes"/>the human race, one single organic<lb break="yes"/>type, modified by circumstances which<lb break="yes"/>perhaps will ever remain unknown.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Though the nations of the new con-<lb break="no"/>tinent are connected by intimate ties,<lb break="yes"/>they exhibit, in the mobility of their<lb break="yes"/>features, in their complexions, tanned<lb break="yes"/>in a greater or less degree, and in their<lb break="yes"/>stature, a difference as remarkable as<lb break="yes"/>the Arabians, the Persians, and Scla-<lb break="no"/>vonians, who are all of the Caucasian<lb break="yes"/>race. The hordes who wander along<lb break="yes"/>the burning plains of the equinoctial<lb break="yes"/>regions have, however, no darker<lb break="yes"/>skins than the mountaineers of the<lb break="yes"/>temperate zone; whether it be that in<lb break="yes"/>the human race, and in the greater<lb break="yes"/>part of animals, there is a certain pe-<lb break="no"/>riod of organic life, beyond which the<lb break="yes"/>influence of climate and food have no<lb break="yes" />effect, or that the deviation from the<lb break="yes"/>primitive type becomes apparent only<lb break="yes"/>after a long series of ages. Besides,<lb break="yes"/>every thing concurs to prove, that the<lb break="yes" />Americans, as well as the people of the<lb break="yes"/>Mongul race, have less flexibility of<lb break="yes"/>organization than the other nations of<lb break="yes"/>Asia and Europe.</p>

                <p>The number of languages, which<lb break="yes"/>distinguish the different native tribes,<lb break="yes"/>appears still more considerable in the<lb break="yes"/>new continent than in Africa, where,<lb break="yes"/>according to the late researches of<lb break="yes"/>Messrs. Seetzen and Vater, there are<lb break="yes"/>above one hundred and forty. In this<lb break="yes" />respect, the whole of America re-<lb break="no"/>sembles Caucasus, Italy before the<lb break="yes"/>conquest of the Romans, Asia Minor<lb break="yes" />when that country contained, on a<lb break="yes"/>small extent of territory, the Cilici-<lb break="no"/>ans of Semitic race, the Phrygians of<lb break="yes" />Thracian origin, the Lydians, and<lb break="yes"/>the Celts. The configuration of the<lb break="yes"/>soil, the strength of vegetation, the<lb break="yes" />apprehensions of the mountaineers<lb break="yes"/>under the tropics of exposing them-<lb break="no"/>selves to the burning heat of the<lb break="yes" />plains, are obstacles to communica-<lb break="no"/>tion, and contribute to the amazing<lb break="yes"/>variety of American dialects.

                    <pb n="610" facs="#f0003"/>variety, it is observed, is more res-<lb break="no" />trained in the savannahs and forests of<lb break="yes"/>the north, which are easily traversed<lb break="yes"/>by the hunter, on the banks of great<lb break="yes"/>rivers along the coast of the ocean,<lb break="yes"/>and in every country where the Incas<lb break="yes"/>had established their theocracy by the<lb break="yes"/>force of arms.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>When it is asserted, that several<lb break="yes"/>hundred languages are found in a con-<lb break="no"/>tinent, the whole population of which<lb break="yes"/>is not equal to that of France, we re-<lb break="no"/>gard as different those languages, which<lb break="yes"/>bear the same affinity to each other, I<lb break="yes"/>will not say as the German and the<lb break="yes"/>Dutch, or the Italian and the Spanish,<lb break="yes"/>but as the Danish and the German,<lb break="yes"/>the Chaldean and the Arabic, the<lb break="yes" />Greek and the Latin. In proportion<lb break="yes"/>as we penetrate into the labyrinth of<lb break="yes"/>American idioms, we discover, that<lb break="yes" />several are susceptible of being classed<lb break="yes"/>by families, while a still greater num-<lb break="no"/>ber remain insulated, like the Biscayan<lb break="yes"/>among European, and the Japanese<lb break="yes"/>among Asiatic languages. This se-<lb break="no"/>paration may, however, be only ap-<lb break="no"/>parent; for we may presume that the<lb break="yes"/>languages, which seem to admit of no<lb break="yes"/>ethnographical classification, have some<lb break="yes"/>affinity, either with other languages<lb break="yes" />which have been for a long time ex-<lb break="no"/>tinct, or with the idioms of nations<lb break="yes"/>which have never yet been visited by<lb break="yes" />travellers.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The greater part of the American<lb break="yes"/>languages, even such as have the same<lb break="yes"/>difference with each other as the lan-<lb break="no" />guages of Germanic origin, the Celtic<lb break="yes"/>and the Sclavonian, bear a certain<lb break="yes"/>analogy in the whole of their organi-<lb break="no" />zation: for instance, in the compli-<lb break="no"/>cation of grammatical forms, in the<lb break="yes"/>modification of the verb according to<lb break="yes"/>the nature of its syntax, and in the<lb break="yes"/>number of additive particles (affixa<lb break="yes"/>et suffixa).

                <p>Investigations made with the most<lb break="yes"/>scrupulous exactness, in following a<lb break="yes"/>method which had not hitherto been<lb break="yes" />used in the study of etymologies, have<lb break="yes"/>proved, that there are a few words that<lb break="yes"/>are common in the vocabularies of the<lb break="yes"/>two continents. In eighty-three Ame-<lb break="no"/>rican languages, examined by Messrs.<lb break="yes"/>Barton and Vater, one hundred and<lb break="yes"/>seventy words have been found, the<lb break="yes"/>
                    <cb/>roots of which appear to be the same;<lb break="yes"/>and it is easy to perceive, that this<lb break="yes"/>analogy is not accidental, since it does<lb break="yes"/>not rest merely on imitative harmony,<lb break="yes"/>or on that conformity in the organs,<lb break="yes"/>which produces almost a perfect iden-<lb break="no"/>tity in the first sounds articulated by<lb break="yes" />children. Of these one hundred and<lb break="yes"/>seventy words, which have this con-<lb break="no"/>nexion with each other, three fifths<lb break="yes" />resemble the Mantchou, the Tongouse,<lb break="yes"/>the Mongul, and the Samoyede; and<lb break="yes"/>two fifths the Celtic and Tschoud, the<lb break="yes"/>Biscayan, the Coptic, and the Congo<lb break="yes"/>languages. These words have been<lb break="yes"/>found by comparing the whole of the<lb break="yes"/>American languages with the whole of<lb break="yes"/>those of the old world; for hitherto<lb break="yes"/>we are acquainted with no American<lb break="yes"/>idiom, which seems to have an exclu-<lb break="no" />sive correspondence with any of the<lb break="yes"/>Asiatic, African, or European tongues.<lb break="yes"/>What some learned writers have as-<lb break="no"/>serted from abstract theories, respect-<lb break="no"/>ing the pretended poverty of all the<lb break="yes"/>American languages, and the extreme<lb break="yes"/>imperfection of their numerical sys-<lb break="no" />tem, is as doubtful as the assertions<lb break="yes"/>which have been made respecting the<lb break="yes"/>weakness and stupidity of the human<lb break="yes"/>race throughout the new continent,<lb break="yes"/>the stunted growth of animated na-<lb break="no"/>ture, and the degeneration of those<lb break="yes"/>animals, which have been transported<lb break="yes"/>from one hemisphere to the other.</p>

A great<lb break="yes"/>staircase led to the top of the trun-<lb break="no"/>cated pyramid, and on the summit of<lb break="yes"/>the platform were one or two chapels,<lb break="yes"/>built like towers, which contained the<lb break="yes"/>

                <p>Another very remarkable tradition<lb break="yes"/>still exists among the Indians of Cho-<lb break="no"/>lula, according to which the great py-<lb break="no" />ramid was not originally destined to<lb break="yes"/>serve for the worship of Quetzalcoatl.<lb break="yes"/>After my return to Europe, on exami-<lb break="no"/>ning at Rome the Mexican manuscript<lb break="yes"/>in the Vatican library, I found, that<lb break="yes"/>this same tradition was already record-<lb break="no"/>ed in a manuscript of Pedro de Los<lb break="yes" />Rios, a Dominican monk, who, in 1566,<lb break="yes"/>copied on the very spot all the hiero-<lb break="no"/>glyphical paintings he could procure.<lb break="yes"/>“Before the great inundation which<lb break="yes"/>took place four thousand eight hun-<lb break="no"/>dred years after the creation of the<lb break="yes"/>World, the country of Anahuac was<lb break="yes"/>inhabited by giants (tzocuillixeque).<lb break="yes"/>All those who did not perish were<lb break="yes"/>transformed into fishes, save seven,<lb break="yes"/>who fled into caverns. When the<lb break="yes"/>waters subsided, one of these giants,<lb break="yes"/>Xelhua, surnamed the architect, went<lb break="yes"/>to Cholollan; where, as a memorial<lb break="yes"/>of the mountain Tlaloc, which had<lb break="yes"/>served for an asylum to himself and<lb break="yes"/>his six brethren, he built an artificial<lb break="yes"/>hill in form of a pyramid. He ordered<lb break="yes"/>bricks to be made in the province of<lb break="yes" />Tlamanalco, at the foot of the Sierra<lb break="yes"/>of Cocotl, and to convey them to Cho-<lb break="no"/>lula he placed a file of men, who pas-<lb break="no" />sed them from hand to hand.

                    <cb/> were it placed on the top of the Peak<lb break="yes"/>of Teneriffe. Cotopaxi is also the<lb break="yes"/>most dreadful volcano of the kingdom<lb break="yes"/>of Quito, and its explosions the most<lb break="yes"/>frequent and diastrous. The mass of<lb break="yes"/>scoriæ, and the huge pieces of rock,<lb break="yes"/>thrown out of this volcano, which are<lb break="yes" />spread over the neighbouring valleys,<lb break="yes"/>covering a surface of several square<lb break="yes"/>leagues, would form, were they heap-<lb break="no"/>ed together, a colossal mountain. In<lb break="yes"/>1738 the flames of Cotopaxi rose nine<lb break="yes"/>hundred metres above the brink of the<lb break="yes"/>crater. In 1744 the roarings of the<lb break="yes" />volcano were heard as far as Honda,<lb break="yes"/>a town on the borders of the Magda-<lb break="no"/>lena, and at the distance of two hun-<lb break="no" />dred common leagues. On the 4th<lb break="yes"/>of April, 1768, the quantity of ashes<lb break="yes"/>ejected by the mouth of Cotopaxi was<lb break="yes"/>so great, that in the towns of Hambato<lb break="yes"/>and Tacunga day broke only at three<lb break="yes"/>in the afternoon, and the inhabitants<lb break="yes" />were obliged to use lanterns in walk-<lb break="no"/>ing the streets. The explosion which<lb break="yes"/>took place in the month of January,<lb break="yes"/>1803, was preceded by a dreadful phe-<lb break="no"/>nomenon, the sudden melting of the<lb break="yes"/>snows that covered the mountain.<lb break="yes"/>For twenty years before no smoke or<lb break="yes"/>vapour, that could be perceived, had<lb break="yes"/>issued from the crater; and in a single<lb break="yes"/>night the subterraneous fire became so<lb break="yes" />active, that at sun-rise the external<lb break="yes"/>walls of the cone, heated, no doubt, to<lb break="yes"/>a very considerable temperature, ap-<lb break="no"/>peared naked, and of the dark colour,<lb break="yes"/>which is peculiar to vitrified scoriæ.<lb break="yes"/>At the port of Guayaquil, fifty-two<lb break="yes"/>leagues distant in a straight line from<lb break="yes"/>the crater, we heard, day and night,<lb break="yes"/>the noises of the volcano, like conti-<lb break="no"/>nued discharges of a battery; we dis-<lb break="no"/>tinguished these tremendous sounds<lb break="yes"/>even on the Pacific Ocean, to the south-<lb break="no"/>west of the island of Puna.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The form of Cotopaxi is the most<lb break="yes"/>beautiful and regular of the colos-<lb break="no"/>sal summits of the high Andes. It<lb break="yes"/>is a perfect cone, which, covered with<lb break="yes"/>an enormous layer of snow, shines with<lb break="yes"/>dazzling splendor at the setting of the<lb break="yes"/>sun, and detaches itself in the most<lb break="yes" />picturesque manner from the azure<lb break="yes"/>vault of heaven. This covering of<lb break="yes"/>snow conceals from the eye of the ob-<lb break="no" />server even the smallest inequalities of<lb break="yes"/>the soil; no point of rock, no stony<lb break="yes"/>mass, penetrates this coating of ice, or<lb break="yes"/>breaks the regularity of the figure of<lb break="yes"/>the cone. The summit of Cotopaxi<lb break="yes"/>resembles the Sugar-loaf (Pan de<lb break="yes"/>azucar) which terminates the Peak<lb break="yes"/>
                    <cb/> of Teyde; but the height of its con<lb break="yes"/>is six times the height of that of the<lb break="yes"/>great volcano of the Island of Tene-<lb break="no"/>riffe.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The greater the regularity in the<lb break="yes"/>form of the cone of this volcano the<lb break="yes"/>more we are struck in finding, on the<lb break="yes" />side to the south-east, a small mass of<lb break="yes"/>rock, half concealed under the snow,<lb break="yes"/>studded with points, and which the<lb break="yes"/>natives call the head of the Inca. The<lb break="yes"/>origin of this singular denomination is<lb break="yes"/>very uncertain. A popular tradition<lb break="yes"/>prevails in the country that this iso-<lb break="no"/>lated rock was heretofore a part of the<lb break="yes"/>top of Cotopaxi. The Indians relate<lb break="yes"/>that the volcano, at its first eruption,<lb break="yes"/>ejected far off a stony mass; which,<lb break="yes"/>like the cap of a dome, covered the<lb break="yes"/>enormous cavity that contains the sub-<lb break="no"/>terraneous fire. Some pretend that<lb break="yes"/>this extraordinary catastrophe took<lb break="yes" />place a short time after the invasion of<lb break="yes"/>the kingdom of Quito by the Inca Tu-<lb break="no"/>pac Yupanqui; and that the rock to<lb break="yes" />the left of the volcano, is called the<lb break="yes"/>head of the Inca, because its fall was<lb break="yes"/>the ominous presage of the death of<lb break="yes"/>the conqueror. Others, still more<lb break="yes"/>credulous, affirm that this mass of por-<lb break="no"/>phyry, with basis of pitchstone, was<lb break="yes"/>displaced in an explosion that happen-<lb break="no"/>ed at the very moment when the Inca<lb break="yes"/>Atahualpa was strangled by the Spa-<lb break="no"/>niards at Caxamarca.</p>

                <p>The want of letters observed in the<lb break="yes"/>new continent, at the time of its se-<lb break="no"/>cond discovery by Christopher Co-<lb break="no"/>lumbus, leads to the idea that the<lb break="yes"/>tribes of the Tartar or Mongul race,<lb break="yes"/>which we may suppose to have passed<lb break="yes" />from the east of Asia to America,<lb break="yes"/>were not in possession of alphabetical<lb break="yes"/>writing; or what is less probable, that,<lb break="yes"/>having relapsed into barbarism under<lb break="yes"/>the influence of a climate less favour-<lb break="no"/>able to the display of the understand-<lb break="no"/>ing, they had lost this wonderful art,<lb break="yes"/>known only to a very small number of<lb break="yes" />individuals. We shall not here exa-<lb break="no"/>mine the question, whether the Deva-<lb break="no"/>nagari alphabet is of remote antiquity<lb break="yes" />on the banks of the Indus and the<lb break="yes"/>Ganges; or whether, as Strabo asserts<lb break="yes"/>from Megasthenes, the Hindoos were<lb break="yes" />ignorant of writing before the conquests<lb break="yes"/>of Alexander. Farther to the east<lb break="yes"/>and the north in the region of mono-<lb break="no" />syllabic languages, as in that of the<lb break="yes"/>Tartarian, Samoiede, Ostiack, and<lb break="yes"/>Kamtschadale tongues, the use of let-<lb break="no" />ters, wherever it is at present found,<lb break="yes"/>

It seems<lb break="yes"/>indeed probable that it was the Chris-<lb break="no"/>tian sect of Nestorians, who communi-<lb break="no"/>cated the Stranghelo alphabet to the<lb break="yes"/>Oighours and the Manchou Tartars;<lb break="yes"/>an alphabet, which in the northern re-<lb break="no"/>gions of Asia is still more recent than<lb break="yes" />the Runic characters in the north of<lb break="yes"/>Europe. We need not therefore sup-<lb break="no"/>pose the communications between<lb break="yes" />eastern Asia and America to have been<lb break="yes"/>of very remote antiquity, in order to<lb break="yes"/>comprehend why this latter part of the<lb break="yes"/>world had not been instructed in an<lb break="yes"/>art, which for a long series of ages<lb break="yes"/>was unknown, except in Egypt, in the<lb break="yes"/>Phœnician and Grecian colonies, and<lb break="yes"/>in the small space lying between the<lb break="yes"/>Mediterranean, the Oxus, and the Per-<lb break="no"/>sian gulf.</p>

                <p>The first missionaries who visited<lb break="yes"/>America, Valades and Acosta, have<lb break="yes"/>already called the Azteck paintings a<lb break="yes" />writing similar to that of the Egyptians.<lb break="yes"/>If Kircher, Warburton, and other<lb break="yes"/>learned men, have since contested the<lb break="yes"/>propriety of this expression, it is be-<lb break="no"/>cause they have not distinguished the<lb break="yes"/>paintings of a mixed kind, in which real<lb break="yes"/>hieroglyphics, sometimes curiological,<lb break="yes" />sometimes tropical, are added to the<lb break="yes"/>natural representation of an action,<lb break="yes"/>from simple hieroglyphical writing,<lb break="yes" />such as is found, not on the pyramidion,<lb break="yes"/>but on the great faces of the obelisks.<lb break="yes"/>The famous inscription of Thebes,<lb break="yes"/>cited by Plutarch, and by Clement of<lb break="yes" />Alexandria, the only one, the expla-<lb break="no"/>nation of which has reached us, ex-<lb break="no"/>pressed by the hieroglyphics of a child,<lb break="yes"/>an old man, a vulture, a fish, and a<lb break="yes" />hippopotamus, the following sentence,<lb break="yes"/>“You who are born, and who are to die,<lb break="yes"/>know, that the Eternal hates impu-<lb break="no" />dence.” A Mexican, to express the<lb break="yes"/>same idea, would have represented the<lb break="yes"/>great spirit, Teotl, chastising a crimi-<lb break="no"/>nal; certain characters placed above<lb break="yes"/>two heads would have been sufficient<lb break="yes"/>to indicate the age of the child, and<lb break="yes"/>that of the old man; he would have<lb break="yes" />individualized the action, but the<lb break="yes"/>style of his hieroglyphical paintings<lb break="yes"/>would not have furnished him with the<lb break="yes"/>means of giving a general expression<lb break="yes"/>to the sentiment of hatred and ven-<lb break="no"/>geance.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>When we compare the Mexican<lb break="yes"/>paintings with the hieroglyphics that<lb break="yes"/>decorated the temples, the obelisks,<lb break="yes" />and perhaps even the pyramids of<lb break="yes"/>Egypt; and reflect on the progressive<lb break="yes"/>steps which the human mind appears<lb break="yes"/>
                    <cb/>to have followed in the invention of<lb break="yes"/>graphic means fitted to express ideas;<lb break="yes"/>we see that the nations of America<lb break="yes"/>were very distant from that perfection<lb break="yes"/>which the Egyptians had obtained.<lb break="yes"/>The Aztecks were indeed but little<lb break="yes"/>acquainted with simple hieroglyphics;<lb break="yes" />they could represent the elements, and<lb break="yes"/>the relations of time and of place; but<lb break="yes"/>it is only by a great number of these<lb break="yes"/>characters, susceptible of being em-<lb break="no"/>ployed separately, that the painting<lb break="yes"/>of ideas becomes easy, and approxi-<lb break="no"/>mates to writing. We find among the<lb break="yes" />Aztecks the germes of phonetic cha-<lb break="no"/>racters: they knew how to write<lb break="yes"/>names, by uniting certain signs which<lb break="yes" />are associated with sounds; this contri-<lb break="no"/>vance might have led them to the beau-<lb break="no"/>tiful discovery of giving an alphabetic<lb break="yes"/>form to their simple hieroglyphics;<lb break="yes"/>but ages would have elapsed before<lb break="yes"/>these nations of mountaineers, who<lb break="yes"/>adhered to their manners and customs<lb break="yes"/>with the same invincible obstinacy as<lb break="yes"/>the Chinese, the Japanese, and the<lb break="yes"/>Hindoos, could have raised themselves<lb break="yes"/>to the decomposition of words, the<lb break="yes"/>analysis of sounds, the invention of an<lb break="yes"/>alphabet.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Among the Mexican people the fi-<lb break="no"/>gures and symbolic characters were not<lb break="yes"/>traced on separate leaves. Whatever<lb break="yes"/>was the substance employed for manu-<lb break="no"/>scripts, they were seldom destined to<lb break="yes"/>form rolls, but were almost always<lb break="yes" />folded in zigzag, in a particular man-<lb break="no"/>ner, like the mounts of our fans. Two<lb break="yes"/>tablets of light wood were pasted at<lb break="yes"/>the ends, one at top, the other at bot-<lb break="no"/>tom, so that before the painting was<lb break="yes"/>unfolded the manuscript had the most<lb break="yes"/>perfect resemblance with our bound<lb break="yes" />books. By this arrangement, on open-<lb break="no"/>ing a Mexican manuscript as we open<lb break="yes"/>our books, we can see only half of the<lb break="yes" />characters at one time, those which<lb break="yes"/>are painted on the same side of the<lb break="yes"/>skin, or paper of maguey: to examine<lb break="yes" />the whole of the pages, if the different<lb break="yes"/>folds of a band, which is often twelve<lb break="yes"/>or fifteen metres in length, can be call-<lb break="no"/>ed pages, we must extend the whole<lb break="yes" />manuscript first from the left to the<lb break="yes"/>right, and then from the right to the<lb break="yes"/>left. In this respect the Mexican<lb break="yes" />paintings are perfectly similar to the<lb break="yes"/>Siamese manuscripts, preserved in the<lb break="yes"/>public library at Paris, which are also<lb break="yes"/>folded in zigzag.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>

                <p>From the researches I have made, it<lb break="yes"/>appears that there exist at present in<lb break="yes"/>Europe only six collections of Mexi-<lb break="no" />can paintings, those of the Escurial,<lb break="yes"/>Bologna, Veletri, Rome, Vienna, and<lb break="yes"/>Berlin. The learned jesuit Fabrega,<lb break="yes" />who is often cited in the works of Mr.<lb break="yes"/>Zoega, and whose manuscripts relating<lb break="yes"/>to the Azteck antiquities were com-<lb break="no"/>municated to me by the Chevalier Bor-<lb break="no"/>gia, nephew to the Cardinal of that<lb break="yes"/>name, supposes that the archives of<lb break="yes"/>Simancas, in Spain, contain also some<lb break="yes"/>of these hieroglyphical paintings,<lb break="yes"/>which Robertson has so aptly denomi-<lb break="no"/>nated picture writings.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The collection preserved at the<lb break="yes"/>Escurial has been examined by Mr.<lb break="yes"/>Waddilove, chaplain to the English<lb break="yes" />embassy at Madrid when Lord Gran-<lb break="no"/>tham was ambassador.

The ob-<lb break="no"/>jects represented seem to prove that<lb break="yes"/>the collection of the Escurial, like<lb break="yes" />those of Italy and Vienna, are either<lb break="yes"/>astrological books or real rituals,<lb break="yes"/>which point out the religious ceremo-<lb break="no"/>nies prescribed for particular days of<lb break="yes"/>the month.

We read on<lb break="yes"/>the first page of this Mexican manu-<lb break="no"/>script that it was sent by King Ema-<lb break="no"/>nuel of Portugal to Pope Clement the<lb break="yes" />Seventh, and that it has since been in<lb break="yes"/>the hands of the Cardinals Hippolito<lb break="yes"/>de Medicis and Capuanus.</p>

                <p>The ninety-sixth page of the Codex<lb break="yes"/>Vaticanus, represents on the left an<lb break="yes"/>adoration: the deity has on a helmet,<lb break="yes" />the ornaments of which are very re-<lb break="no"/>markable: he is seated on a small<lb break="yes"/>bench, called <hi rendition="#i">icpalli,</hi> before a temple,<lb break="yes"/>of which only the top, or small chapel<lb break="yes" />placed on the upper part of the pyra-<lb break="no"/>mid, is represented. The adoration<lb break="yes"/>consisted, at Mexico, as well as in the<lb break="yes"/>East, in the ceremony of touching the<lb break="yes"/>ground with the right hand, and carry-<lb break="no"/>ing the left to the mouth. In the<lb break="yes"/>drawing, No. 1, the homage is ren-<lb break="no"/>dered by a genuflexion; the attitude<lb break="yes"/>of the figure, which prostrates itself<lb break="yes"/>before the temple, is found in several<lb break="yes" />paintings of the Hindoos.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The group, No. 2, represents the<lb break="yes"/>celebrated <hi rendition="#i" >serpentwoman,</hi> Cihuacohuatl,<lb break="yes"/>called also Quilaztli, or Tonacacihua,<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">woman of our flesh</hi>: she is the compa-<lb break="no" />nion of Tonacateuctli. The Mexi-<lb break="no"/>cans considered her as the mother of<lb break="yes"/>the human race; and, after the god<lb break="yes"/>of the <hi rendition="#i">celestial Paradise,</hi> Ometeuetli,<lb break="yes"/>she held the first rank among the di-<lb break="no"/>vinities of Anahuac; we see her al-<lb break="no"/>ways represented with a great serpent.<lb break="yes" />Other paintings exhibit to us a feather-<lb break="no"/>headed snake, cut in pieces by the<lb break="yes"/>great spirit, Tezcatlipoca, or by the<lb break="yes"/>Sun personified, the god Tonatiuh.<lb break="yes"/>These allegories remind us of the<lb break="yes"/>ancient traditions of Asia. In the<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">woman and serpent</hi> of the Aztecks we<lb break="yes" />think we perceive the Eve of the Se-<lb break="no"/>metic nations: in the snake cut in<lb break="yes"/>pieces, the famous serpent <hi rendition="#i" >Kaliya,</hi> or<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">Kalinaga,</hi> conquered by Vishnu, when<lb break="yes"/>he took the form of Krishna. The<lb break="yes"/>Tonatiuh of the Mexicans appears also<lb break="yes"/>to be identical with the Krishua of the<lb break="yes" />Hindoos, recorded in the Bhagavata<lb break="yes"/>Purana, and with the Mithras of the<lb break="yes"/>Persians. The most ancient traditions<lb break="yes"/>of nations go back to a state of things,<lb break="yes"/>when the earth, covered with bogs,<lb break="yes"/>was inhabited by snakes and other<lb break="yes"/>animals of gigantic bulk: the benefi-<lb break="no" />cent luminary, by drying up the soil,<lb break="yes"/>delivered the earth from these aquatic<lb break="yes"/>monsters.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Behind the serpent, who appears to<lb break="yes"/>be speaking to the goddess Cihuaco-<lb break="no"/>huatl, are two naked figures; they<lb break="yes"/>
                    <cb/>are of a different colour, and seem to<lb break="yes"/>be in the attitude of contending with<lb break="yes"/>each other. We might be led to sup-<lb break="no"/>pose, that the two vases, which we<lb break="yes"/>see at the bottom of the picture, one<lb break="yes"/>of which is overturned, is the cause of<lb break="yes"/>this contention. The serpent woman<lb break="yes"/>was considered at Mexico as the mo-<lb break="no"/>ther of two twin children; these naked<lb break="yes"/>figures are perhaps the children of Ci-<lb break="no" />huacohuatl; they remind us of the<lb break="yes"/>Cain and Abel of Hebrew tradition.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>It is no way doubtful, that Nesto-<lb break="no"/>rianism, mingled with the dogmata<lb break="yes"/>of the Bouddhistes and the Shamans,<lb break="yes" />spread through Mantchou Tartary<lb break="yes"/>into the north-east of Asia: we may<lb break="yes"/>therefore suppose, with some appear-<lb break="no"/>ance of reason, that Christian ideas<lb break="yes"/>have been communicated by the same<lb break="yes"/>means to the Mexican nations, espe-<lb break="no" />cially to the inhabitants of that<lb break="yes"/>northern region, from which the Tol-<lb break="no"/>tecks emigrated, and which we must<lb break="yes" />consider as the <hi rendition="#i">officina virorum</hi> of the<lb break="yes" />New World.</p>

                <p>When we examine this question by<lb break="yes"/>the rules of the most rigid analysis,<lb break="yes"/>we find nothing among the Americans,<lb break="yes"/>which leads to the supposition, that<lb break="yes"/>the Asiatic nations migrated to the<lb break="yes"/>New Continent after the establishment<lb break="yes"/>of Christianity. I am very far from<lb break="yes"/>denying the possibility of these pos-<lb break="no"/>terior communications; I am not ig-<lb break="no"/>norant that the Tchoutskis annually<lb break="yes"/>crossed Behring’s Straits to make war<lb break="yes"/>on the inhabitants of the north-west<lb break="yes"/>coast of America; but I think I may<lb break="yes"/>affirm, from the knowledge we have<lb break="yes"/>acquired since the end of the last cen-<lb break="no"/>tury of the sacred books of the Hin-<lb break="no"/>doos, that, in order to explain these<lb break="yes"/>resemblances of traditions, of which<lb break="yes" />all the first missionaries speak, we<lb break="yes"/>have no need to recur to Western<lb break="yes"/>Asia, peopled by nations of the Se-<lb break="no" />metic race; these same traditions, of<lb break="yes"/>high and venerable antiquity, are<lb break="yes"/>found both among the followers of<lb break="yes" />Brahma, and among the Shamans of<lb break="yes"/>the eastern steppes of Tartary.</p>

The volcanoes which<lb break="yes"/>are yet burning, those which have but<lb break="yes"/>a single crater of extraordinary size,<lb break="yes"/>are conic mountains, with summits<lb break="yes"/>truncated in a greater or less degree:<lb break="yes"/>such is the figure of Cotopaxi, of Po-<lb break="no"/>pocatepec, and the Peak of Orizaba.<lb break="yes"/>Volcanoes, the summits of which have<lb break="yes" />sunk after a long series of eruptions,<lb break="yes"/>exhibit ridges bristled with points,<lb break="yes"/>needles leaning in different directions,<lb break="yes"/>and broken rocks falling into ruins.<lb break="yes"/>Such is the form of the Altar, or<lb break="yes"/>Capac-Urcu, a mountain once more<lb break="yes"/>lofty than Chimborazo, and the de-<lb break="no"/>struction of which is considered as a<lb break="yes"/>memorable period in the natural his-<lb break="no"/>tory of the New Continent; such is<lb break="yes"/>the form also of Carguairazo, a great<lb break="yes"/>part of which fell in on the night of<lb break="yes"/>the 19th of July, 1698. Torrents of<lb break="yes"/>water and mud then issued from the<lb break="yes"/>opened sides of the mountain, and<lb break="yes"/>laid waste the neighbouring country.<lb break="yes"/>This dreadful catastrophe was accom-<lb break="no"/>panied by an earthquake, which, in<lb break="yes"/>the adjacent towns of Hambato, and<lb break="yes" />Llactacunga, swallowed up thousands<lb break="yes"/>of inhabitants.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>A third form of the high tops of the<lb break="yes"/>Andes, and the most majestic of the<lb break="yes"/>whole, is that of Chimborazo, the<lb break="yes"/>summit of which is circular; it re-<lb break="no"/>minds us of those paps without cra-<lb break="no"/>ters, which the elastic force of the va-<lb break="no"/>
                    <cb/> pours swells up in regions where the<lb break="yes"/>hollow crust of the globe is mined by<lb break="yes"/>subterraneous fires. The aspect of<lb break="yes"/>mountains of granite has little analogy<lb break="yes"/>with that of Chimborazo. The gra-<lb break="no"/>nitic summits are flattened hemis-<lb break="no"/>pheres; the trappean porphyry forms<lb break="yes" />slender cupolas. Thus on the shore<lb break="yes"/>of the South Sea, after the long rains<lb break="yes"/>of winter, when the transparency of<lb break="yes" />the air has suddenly increased, we see<lb break="yes"/>Chimborazo appear like a cloud at the<lb break="yes"/>horizon; it detaches itself from the<lb break="yes"/>neighbouring summits, and towers<lb break="yes"/>over the whole chain of the Andes,<lb break="yes"/>like that majestic dome, produced by<lb break="yes"/>the genius of Michael Angelo, over<lb break="yes"/>the antique monuments, which sur-<lb break="no"/>round the Capitol.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Travellers who have approached the<lb break="yes"/>summits of Mont Blanc and Mont Rose<lb break="yes"/>are alone capable of feeling the cha-<lb break="no" />racter of this calm, majestic, and so-<lb break="no"/>lemn scenery. The bulk of Chimbo-<lb break="no"/>razo is so enormous, that the part<lb break="yes" />which the eye embraces at once near<lb break="yes"/>the limit of the eternal snows is seven<lb break="yes"/>thousand metres in breadth. The ex-<lb break="no" />treme rarity of the strata of air, across<lb break="yes"/>which we see the tops of the Andes,<lb break="yes"/>contributes greatly to the splendour of<lb break="yes"/>the snow, and the magical effect of its<lb break="yes" />reflection. Under the tropics, at a<lb break="yes"/>height of five thousand metres,<note place="foot" n="*">39,371 inches.</note> the<lb break="yes" />azure vault of the sky appears of an<lb break="yes"/>indigo tint. The outlines of the moun-<lb break="no"/>tain detach themselves from the sky in<lb break="yes"/>this pure and transparent atmosphere,<lb break="yes"/>while the inferior strata of the air, re-<lb break="no"/>posing on a plain destitute of vegeta-<lb break="no"/>tion, which reflects the radiant heat,<lb break="yes" />are vaporous, and appear to veil the<lb break="yes"/>middle ground of the landscape.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The elevated plain of Tapia, which<lb break="yes"/>extends to the east as far as the foot of<lb break="yes"/>the altar, and of Condorasto, is three<lb break="yes"/>thousand metres in height, nearly equal<lb break="yes"/>to that of Canigou, one of the highest<lb break="yes"/>summits of the Pyrennees. A few<lb break="yes"/>plants of schinus, molle, cactus, agave,<lb break="yes" />and molina, are scattered over the<lb break="yes"/>barren plain: and we see in the fore-<lb break="no"/>ground lamas (camelus lacma) sketch-<lb break="no"/>ed from nature, and groups of Indians<lb break="yes"/>going to the market of Lican. The<lb break="yes"/>flank of the mountain presents that<lb break="yes" />gradation of vegetable life, which I<lb break="yes"/>have endeavoured to trace in my chart<lb break="yes"/>of the Geography of plants, and which<lb break="yes" />may be followed on the western top of<lb break="yes"/>the Andes from the impenetrable<lb break="yes"/>

                <p>At three thousand five hundred<lb break="yes"/>metres absolute height, the ligneous<lb break="yes"/>plants with coriaceous and shining<lb break="yes" />leaves nearly disappear. The region<lb break="yes"/>of shrubs is separated from that of the<lb break="yes"/>grasses by alpine plants, by tufts of<lb break="yes"/>nerteria, valerian, saxifrage, and lo-<lb break="no"/>belia, and by small cruciferous plants.<lb break="yes"/>The grasses form a very broad belt,<lb break="yes"/>covered at intervals with snow, which<lb break="yes" />remains but a few days. This belt,<lb break="yes"/>called in the country the <hi rendition="#i">pajonal,</hi> ap-<lb break="no"/>pears at a distance, like a gilded yellow<lb break="yes"/>carpet. Its colour forms an agreeable<lb break="yes"/>contrast with that of the scattered<lb break="yes"/>masses of snow; and is owing to the<lb break="yes"/>stalks and leaves of the grasses burnt<lb break="yes"/>by the rays of the sun in the seasons of<lb break="yes"/>great draught. Above the <hi rendition="#i">pajonal</hi> lies<lb break="yes"/>the region of cryptogamus plants,<lb break="yes"/>which here and there cover the por-<lb break="no"/>phyritic rocks destitute of vegetable<lb break="yes"/>earth.

                <p>The civil year of the Aztecks was<lb break="yes"/>a solar year of three hundred and sixty-<lb break="no"/>five days, and was divided into eighteen<lb break="yes"/>months, each of twenty days.

It was divided<lb break="yes"/>into eight intervals, a division found<lb break="yes"/>among the Hindoos and the Romans;<lb break="yes"/>four of which were determined by the<lb break="yes"/>rising of the Sun, its setting, and its<lb break="yes"/>

                <p>To correct the lunar year, and make<lb break="yes"/>it coincide with the solar year, eleven<lb break="yes"/>days, according to ancient custom,<lb break="yes" />were added; which, by the edict of<lb break="yes"/>the Inca, were divided among the<lb break="yes"/>twelve moons. According to this ar-<lb break="no" />rangement, it was scarcely possible,<lb break="yes"/>that four equal periods, into which<lb break="yes"/>the lunar months should be divided,<lb break="yes" />could be seven days each, and corre-<lb break="no"/>spond to the phases of the Moon. The<lb break="yes"/>same historian, whose testimony is<lb break="yes" />cited by M. Bailly in favor of the opi-<lb break="no"/>nion, that the week of the Hindoos<lb break="yes"/>was known to the Americans, affirms,<lb break="yes" />that, according to an ancient law of<lb break="yes"/>the Inca Pachacutec, there ought to<lb break="yes"/>be in each lunar month three days for<lb break="yes"/>festivals and for markets <hi rendition="#i">(catu)</hi>; and<lb break="yes"/>that the people were to work, not<lb break="yes"/>seven, but eight consecutive days, and<lb break="yes"/>rest the ninth.

                <p>The history begins by the Deluge<lb break="yes"/>of Coxcox, or the fourth destruc-<lb break="no"/>tion of the world, which, accord-<lb break="no"/>ing to the Azteck cosmogony, termi-<lb break="no"/>nates the fourth of the great cycles,<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">atonatiuh, the age of water.</hi> This cata-<lb break="no" />clysm took place, according to the two<lb break="yes"/>received chronological systems, one<lb break="yes"/>thousand four hundred and seventeen,<lb break="yes" />or eighteen thousand and twenty-eight<lb break="yes"/>years after the beginning of the age of<lb break="yes"/>earth, <hi rendition="#i" >tlaltonatiuh.</hi> The enormous dif-<lb break="no"/>ference of these numbers ought less to<lb break="yes"/>astonish us, when we recollect the hy-<lb break="no"/>potheses, which in our days have been<lb break="yes"/>advanced by Bailly, Sir William Jones,<lb break="yes"/>and Bentley, on the duration of the<lb break="yes"/>five Yougas of the Hindoos. Of the<lb break="yes" />different nations that inhabit Mexico,<lb break="yes"/>paintings representing the deluge of<lb break="yes"/>Coxcox are found among the Aztecks,<lb break="yes" />the Miztecks, the Zapotecks, the<lb break="yes"/>Tlascaltecks, and the Mechoacanese.<lb break="yes"/>The Noah Xisuthrus, or Menou of<lb break="yes" />these nations, is called Coxcox, Teo-<lb break="no"/>Cipactli, or Tezpi. He saved himself<lb break="yes"/>conjointly with his wife, Xochiquetzal,<lb break="yes"/>in a bark, or, according to other tradi-<lb break="no"/>tions, on a raft of <hi rendition="#i">ahuahuete</hi> (cupressus<lb break="yes"/>
                    <cb/>disticha). The painting represents<lb break="yes"/>Coxcox in the midst of the water,<lb break="yes"/>lying in a bark. The mountain, the<lb break="yes" />summit of which, crowned by a tree,<lb break="yes"/>rises above the waters, is the Peak of<lb break="yes"/>Colhuacan, the Ararat of the Mexi-<lb break="no" />cans. The horn, which is represented<lb break="yes"/>on the left, is the phonetic hieroglyphic<lb break="yes"/>of Colhuacan. At the foot of the<lb break="yes"/>mountain appear the heads of Coxcox<lb break="yes"/>and his wife. The latter of these is<lb break="yes"/>known by the two tresses in the form<lb break="yes"/>of horns, which, as we have often ob-<lb break="no" />served, denote the female sex. The<lb break="yes"/>men born after the deluge were dumb:<lb break="yes"/>a dove, from the top of a tree, distri-<lb break="no" />butes among them tougues, represented<lb break="yes"/>under the form of small commas. We<lb break="yes"/>must not confound this dove with the<lb break="yes" />bird which brings Coxcox tidings, that<lb break="yes"/>the waters were dried up. The people<lb break="yes"/>of Mechoacan preserved a tradition,<lb break="yes"/>according to which Coxcox, whom<lb break="yes"/>they called Tezpi, embarked in a spa-<lb break="no"/>cious <hi rendition="#i">acalli</hi> with his wife, his children,<lb break="yes"/>several animals and grain, the preser-<lb break="no"/>vation of which was of importance to<lb break="yes" />mankind. When the great spirit, Tez-<lb break="no"/>catlipoca, ordered the waters to with-<lb break="no"/>draw, Tezpi sent out from his bark a<lb break="yes"/>vulture, the <hi rendition="#i">zopilote</hi> (vultur aura).<lb break="yes"/>This bird, which feeds on dead flesh,<lb break="yes"/>did not return on account of the great<lb break="yes"/>number of carcasses, with which the<lb break="yes"/>earth, recently dried up, was strewed.<lb break="yes" />Tezpi sent out other birds, one of<lb break="yes"/>which, the humming bird, alone re-<lb break="no"/>turned, holding in its beak a branch<lb break="yes" />covered with leaves; Tezpi seeing<lb break="yes"/>that fresh verdure began to clothe the<lb break="yes"/>soil, quitted his bark near the moun-<lb break="no" />tain of Colhuacan.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>These traditions, we here repeat,<lb break="yes"/>remind us of others of high and vene-<lb break="no"/>rable antiquity. The sight of marine<lb break="yes" />substances, found even on the loftiest<lb break="yes"/>summits, might give men, who have<lb break="yes"/>had no communication, the idea of<lb break="yes" />great inundations, which for a certain<lb break="yes"/>time extinguished organic life on the<lb break="yes"/>earth: but ought we not to acknow-<lb break="no"/>ledge the traces of a common origin,<lb break="yes"/>wherever cosmogonical ideas, and the<lb break="yes"/>first traditions of nations, offer striking<lb break="yes"/>analogies even in the minutest circum-<lb break="no"/>stances? does not the humming-bird<lb break="yes"/>of Tezpi remind us of Noah’s dove,<lb break="yes"/>that of Deucalion, and the birds,<lb break="yes"/>which, according to Berosus, Xisuth-<lb break="no"/>rus sent out from his ark, to see whe-<lb break="no"/>ther the waters had run off, and whe-<lb break="no"/>ther he might erect altars to the pro-<lb break="no" />tecting divinities of Chaldea?</p>

                <p>In the description of the cataract of<lb break="yes"/>Tequendama, we have spoken of that<lb break="yes"/>marvellous personage, known in the<lb break="yes" />American mythology under the name<lb break="yes"/>of Bochica, or Idacanzas, who opened<lb break="yes"/>a passage for the waters of the lake<lb break="yes" />of Funzha, assembled the wandering<lb break="yes"/>tribes into a social state, introduced<lb break="yes"/>the worship of the Sun, and, like the<lb break="yes"/>Peruvian Manco-Capac, and the Mex-<lb break="no"/>ican Quetzalcoatl, became the legis-<lb break="no"/>lator of the Muyscas. These same<lb break="yes"/>traditions relate, that Bochica, son<lb break="yes" />and emblem of the Sun, high priest of<lb break="yes"/>Sogamozo, or Iraca, seeing the chiefs<lb break="yes"/>of the different Indian tribes disputing<lb break="yes"/>for the supreme authority, advised<lb break="yes"/>them to choose for zaque, or sovereign,<lb break="yes"/>one among them called Huncahua, re-<lb break="no"/>vered on account of his wisdom and<lb break="yes" />justice. The advice of the high priest<lb break="yes"/>was universally adopted; and Hun-<lb break="no"/>cahua, who reigned two hundred and<lb break="yes"/>fifty years, subdued the whole of the<lb break="yes"/>country that extends from the savan-<lb break="no"/>nahs of San Juan de los Llanos to the<lb break="yes"/>mountains of Opon. Bochica, devot-<lb break="no"/>ing himself to a life of severe penance,<lb break="yes"/>lived a hundred Muysca cycles, or<lb break="yes"/>two thousand years. He disappeared<lb break="yes" />mysteriously at Iraca, to the east of<lb break="yes"/>Tunja. This town, which was then<lb break="yes"/>the most populous in the country, was<lb break="yes" />founded by Huncahua, the first of the<lb break="yes"/>dynasty of the zaques of Cundina-<lb break="no"/>murca; and took the name of Hunca,<lb break="yes" />from its founder, which the Spaniards<lb break="yes"/>afterward changed into that of Tunca,<lb break="yes"/>or Tunja.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The form of government given by<lb break="yes"/>Bochica to the inhabitants of Bogota<lb break="yes"/>is very remarkable from its analogy<lb break="yes" />with those of Japan and Thibet. The<lb break="yes"/>Incas of Peru united in their person<lb break="yes"/>the temporal and spiritual powers.<lb break="yes" />The children of the Sun were both<lb break="yes"/>priests and kings. At Cundinamurca,<lb break="yes"/>at a period probably anterior to Man-<lb break="no"/>co-Capac, Bochica had constituted the<lb break="yes"/>four chiefs of tribes, Gameza, Bus-<lb break="no"/>banca, Pesca, and Toca, electors;<lb break="yes"/>and ordered, that, after his death,<lb break="yes" />these electors, and their descendants,<lb break="yes"/>should have the right of choosing the<lb break="yes"/>high priest of Iraca. The pontiffs, or<lb break="yes"/>lamas, the successors of Bochica, were<lb break="yes" />considered as heirs of his virtue and<lb break="yes"/>sanctity; and such as Cholula, in the<lb break="yes"/>time of Montezuma, was to the Az-<lb break="no" />tecks, Iraca had been to the Muyscas.<lb break="yes"/>The people thronged in crowds to offer<lb break="yes"/>presents to the high priest, visiting<lb break="yes"/>
                    <cb/>those places which were consecrated<lb break="yes"/>by the miracles of Bochica; and amidst<lb break="yes"/>the horrors of the most sanguinary<lb break="yes"/>warfare, the pilgrims enjoyed the pro-<lb break="no"/>tection of those princes, through whose<lb break="yes"/>territories they passed to visit the<lb break="yes"/>sanctuary (<hi rendition="#i">chunsua</hi>), and prostrate them-<lb break="no"/>selves at the feet of the lama, who<lb break="yes"/>presided there. The temporal chief,<lb break="yes"/>called zaque of Tunja, to whom the<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">zippa,</hi> or princes, of Bogota, paid an<lb break="yes" />annual tribute, and the pontiff of Ira-<lb break="no"/>ea, were consequently two distinct<lb break="yes"/>potentates, as the emperor and dairi<lb break="yes" />are in Japan.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Bochica was not only considered as<lb break="yes"/>the founder of a new worship and law-<lb break="no"/>giver of the Muyscas; as emblem of<lb break="yes"/>the sun he regulated the seasons, and<lb break="yes"/>to him was attributed the invention of<lb break="yes"/>the calendar. He had prescribed also<lb break="yes" />the order of the sacrifices, which were<lb break="yes"/>to be celebrated at the end of the<lb break="yes"/>smail cycles, on account of the fifth<lb break="yes"/>lunar intercalation.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The least division of time among<lb break="yes"/>the Muyscas was a period of three<lb break="yes"/>days. The week of seven days was<lb break="yes" />unknown in America, as well as in<lb break="yes"/>part of eastern Asia. On the first day<lb break="yes"/>of this small period a great market<lb break="yes" />was held at Turmequé.</p>
