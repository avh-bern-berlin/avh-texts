The highest point of the earth&#x2019;s surface attained, lies in<lb/>South America on the south-east side of Chimborazo. There<lb/>travellers have reached the height of nearly 18,500 Paris feet<note place="foot" n="*">One French foot is &#x2014; 1.07892, or about 1<formula notation="TeX">\frac{1}{13}</formula> English.&#x2014;Tr.</note><lb/>&#x2014;viz. in June 1802, 3016 toises,<note place="foot" n="&#x2020;">A toise is &#x2014; 1.94904 metres, or 6.39459 English feet.&#x2014;Tr.</note> in December 1831, 3080<lb/>toises, above the level of the sea. Barometrical measurements<lb/>have thus been made, in the chain of the Andes 3720 (Paris)<lb/>feet above the level of the summit of Mont Blanc. The height<lb/>of Mont Blanc is in relation to that of the Cordilleras so incon-<lb/>siderable, that in the latter, there are much frequented passes<lb/>that are higher; indeed, the upper part of the great city of<lb/>Potosi has an elevation only 323 toises inferior to that of the<lb/>summit of Mont Blanc. I have thought it needful to premise<lb/>these numerical statements, in order to present to the imagina-<lb/>tion definite points of comparison for the hypsometric, as it were<lb/>plastic, contemplation of the surface of the earth.</p><lb/><p>The attainment of great heights is of less scientific interest,<lb/>when the same lie far above the snow-line, and can be visited<lb/>for a few hours only. Immediate barometrical measurements<lb/>of heights afford indeed this advantage, that the results are<lb/>quickly obtained, yet the summits are, for the most part, sur-<lb/>rounded by high plains, adapted for trigonometrical operations,<lb/>by which all the elements of the measurements can be repeat-<lb/>edly proved; whilst a single determination by means of the<lb/>barometer, is liable to considerable errors, because of the as-<lb/>cending and descending currents of air on the mountain slopes,<lb/>and the variation in the decrease of temperature thus occasion-<lb/>ed. The nature of the rocks, from the permanent covering<lb/><pb n="292" facs="#f0002" />
of snow, is almost entirely withdrawn from geognostic observa-<lb/>tion, since there are presented only single ridges composed of<lb/>much weathered strata. Organic life ceases in these lofty soli-<lb/>tudes. Scarcely do the condor and winged insects stray into<lb/>these attenuated strata of the atmosphere, the latter being<lb/>carried up by the currents of air. If the endeavours of tra-<lb/>velling natural philosophers, who strive to climb the higher<lb/>summits of the earth, is scarcely rewarded by a serious scien-<lb/>tific interest, there is, on the other hand, an active popular<lb/>participation in such endeavours. That which seems unattain-<lb/>able has a mysterious attractive power; we wish that all<lb/>should be explored,&#x2014;at least attempted, though not to be ob-<lb/>tained. Chimborazo has been the wearisome object of all in-<lb/>quiries addressed to me since my first return to Europe. The<lb/>thoroughly exploring of the most important laws of nature,<lb/>the most vivid delineations of stratified zones of plants and dif-<lb/>ferences in climates, determining, as the latter do, the object of<lb/>agriculture, were seldom capable of diverting attention from<lb/>the snow-clad summit which at that time (before Pentland&#x2019;s<lb/>journey to Bolivia) was supposed to be the culminating point<lb/>of the dike-like Andes.</p><lb/><p>I shall here extract from the still unprinted portion of my<lb/>journals, the simple narration of a mountain journey. The en-<lb/>tire detail of the trigonometrical measurement, which I made at<lb/>New Riobamba in the plain of Tapia, was made known in the<lb/>introduction to the first volume of my <hi rendition="#i">Astronomical Observations,</hi><lb/>soon after my return. The geographical distribution of the<lb/>plants on the acclivity of Chimborazo and the neighbouring<lb/>mountains (from the sea coast up to a height of 14,800 feet),<lb/>I have attempted to represent, by a figure in a table of my<lb/><hi rendition="#i">Geographical and Physical Atlas of South America,</hi> according<lb/>to the excellent determination by Kunth of the alpine vegetation<lb/>of the Cordilleras, collected by Bonpland and myself.</p><lb/><p>The history of the ascent itself, which can present but little<lb/>dramatic interest, was reserved for the fourth and last volume<lb/>of my journey towards the equatorial regions. But since my<lb/>friend M. Boussingault, now Professor of Chemistry at Lyons,<lb/>one of the most talented and learned travellers of modern times,<lb/>has recently, at my request, described in the Annals de Chimie<lb/><pb n="293" facs="#f0003" />
et de Physiques,<note place="foot" n="*">See Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal, vol. xix. for 1835, where there<lb/>is a translation of Boussingault&#x2019;s memoir.</note> this enterprize, which very closely resembles<lb/>my own,&#x2014;and since our observations are mutually confirma-<lb/>tive of each other,&#x2014;this small fragment of a journey, which I<lb/>here lay before the public, will no doubt be favoured with an<lb/>indulgent reception. I shall provisionally refrain from all cir-<lb/>cumstantial geognostic and physical discussions.</p><lb/><p>On the 22d June 1799, I was in the crater of the Peak of<lb/>Teneriffe. Three years afterwards, almost on the same day<lb/>(the 23d June 1802), I reached a point 6700 feet higher, near<lb/>the summit of Chimborazo. After a long delay in the table-<lb/>land of Quito, one of the most wonderful and picturesque regions<lb/>of the earth, we undertook the journey towards the forests of<lb/>the Peruvian bark trees of Loxa, the upper course of the river<lb/>Amazons, westward of the celebrated strait (Pongo de Man-<lb/>seriche), and through the sandy desert along the Peruvian coast<lb/>of the South Sea towards Lima, where we were to observe<lb/>the transit of Mercury on the 9th November 1802. On a plain<lb/>covered with pumice-stone,&#x2014;where (after the fearful earth-<lb/>quake of 4th February 1797) the building of the new city Rio-<lb/>bamba was begun,&#x2014;we enjoyed for several days a splendid view<lb/>of the bell or dome-shaped summit of Chimborazo. We had<lb/>the clearest weather, favouring trigonometrical observation. By<lb/>means of a large telescope, we had thoroughly examined the snow-<lb/>mantle of the mountain, still 15,700 toises distant, and discovered<lb/>several ridges, which, projecting like sterile black streaks, con-<lb/>verged towards the summit, and gave some hope that, upon them,<lb/>a firm footing might be obtained in the region of eternal snow.<lb/>Riobamba Nuevo lies within sight of the enormous and now in-<lb/>dented mountain Capac-urcu, called by the Spaniards El Altar,<lb/>which (says a tradition of the natives) was once higher than<lb/>Chimborazo, and after having been many years in a state of<lb/>eruption, suddenly fell in. This terror-spreading event is said<lb/>to have taken place shortly before the conquest of Quito by the<lb/>Inca Tupac-Yupanqui. Riobamba Nuevo must not be con-<lb/>founded with the old Riobamba of the great map of La Conda-<lb/>mine and Don Pedro Maldonado. The latter city was entirely<lb/><pb n="294" facs="#f0004" />
destroyed by the great catastrophe of the 4th February 1797,<lb/>which in a few minutes destroyed 45,000 human beings. The<lb/>new Riobamba lies, according to my chronometrical observations,<lb/>42 seconds more to the eastward than the old Riobamba, but<lb/>almost in the same latitude (1° 41&#x2032; 46&#x2033; south). We were in<lb/>the plain of Tapia, from which, on the 22d June, we began our<lb/>expedition towards Chimborazo, being already 8898 Paris feet <note place="foot" n="*">Thus 2890 metres. Boussingault calculated this elevation to be 2870<lb/>metres, and estimated the mean temperature of the high plain of Tabia at<lb/>16°.4 C. (61°52 F.)</note><lb/>(1483 toises) above the level of the South Sea. This table-<lb/>land is a part of the valley-land between the Eastern and West-<lb/>ern Andes, <hi rendition="#i">i. e.</hi> between the chain of the active volcanoes Coto-<lb/>paxi and Tungurahua on the one hand, and the chain of the<lb/>Iliniza and Chimborazo on the other. We gently ascended as<lb/>far as the foot of the last mentioned mountain, where, in the<lb/>Indian village Calpi, we were to pass the night. This plain is<lb/>sparingly covered with Cactus stems and Schinus molle, which<lb/>resembles a weeping willow. Herds of variegated llamas, in<lb/>thousands, seek here a scanty subsistence. At so great a height,<lb/>the nightly terrestrial radiation of heat, when the sky is cloudless,<lb/>proves injurious to agriculture, through cold and frost. Before<lb/>reaching Calpi, we visited Lican, now likewise a small village,<lb/>but before the conquest of the country by the eleventh Inca, <note place="foot" n="&#x2020;">The same Tupac-Yupanqui, whose well preserved remains, Garcillasso<lb/>de la Vega, so lately as in 1559, had seen in the family-vault at Cuzco.</note><lb/>a considerable city, and the place of residence of the Concho-<lb/>cando, or Prince of Puruay. The natives believe that the few<lb/>wild llamas found on the western side of Chimborazo, are de-<lb/>rived from dispersed and fugitive herds, which, after the de-<lb/>struction of the old Lican, became wild.</p><lb/><p>Very near to Calpi, north-westward of Lican, there is in the<lb/>barren table-land a little isolated hill, the <hi rendition="#i">black mountain</hi>, Yana-<lb/>Urcu, the name of which has not been given by the French aca-<lb/>demicians, but which, in a geognostical point of view, deserves<lb/>much attention. The hill lies SS.E. of Chimborazo, at a dis-<lb/>tance of less than three miles (15 to 1°), and separated from the<lb/>same by the high plain of Luisa only. If in it we do not re-<lb/><pb n="295" facs="#f0005" />
cognise a lateral eruption of Chimborazo, the origin of the cone<lb/>must certainly be ascribed to the subterranean forces which,<lb/>under that mountain, have for thousands of years vainly sought<lb/>an opening. It is of later origin than the elevation of the great<lb/>dome-shaped mountain. The Yana-Urcu forms, with the northern<lb/>hill Naguangachi, a connected eminence in the form of a horse-<lb/>shoe; the bow, more than a semicircle, is open towards the<lb/>east. There probably lies in the centre of the horse-shoe, the<lb/>point out of which the black slags have been thrown, that now<lb/>lie spread far around. We found there a funnel-shaped depres-<lb/>sion of about 120 feet in depth, in the interior of which there is<lb/>a small hill, whose height does not equal that of the surround-<lb/>ing margin. Yana-Urcu probably signifies the southern culmi-<lb/>nating point of the old crater-margin, which, at the most, is ele-<lb/>vated 400 feet above the level of Calpi. Naguangachi signifies<lb/>the northern lower end. The whole eminence reminds one,&#x2014;<lb/>through its horse-shoe form, not in regard to its rock,&#x2014;of the<lb/>somewhat higher hill Javirac (el Panecillo de Quito), which<lb/>rises isolated at the foot of the volcano Pichincha, in the plain of<lb/>Turubamba, and which, in La Condamine&#x2019;s, or rather Morain-<lb/>ville&#x2019;s map, is drawn erroneously as a perfect cone. According to<lb/>the tradition of the natives, and according to old MSS which the<lb/>Cacike or Apu of Lican (the Conchocandi) possessed, the vol-<lb/>canic eruption of the Yana-Urca occurred immediately after<lb/>the death of the Inca Tupa-Yupanqui:&#x2014;thus probably in the<lb/>middle of the 15th century. Tradition says that a fire-ball, or<lb/>indeed a star, fell from heaven and set on fire the mountain.<lb/>Such fables, connecting the fall of a&#x00EB;rolites with eruptions are<lb/>also spread among the tribes of Mexico. The rock of the<lb/>Yana-Urcu is a porous dark clove-coloured, often entirely black<lb/>slaggy mass, which may be easily confounded with porous ba-<lb/>salt. Olivin is entirely wanting in it, the white, sparingly dis-<lb/>tributed crystals it contains are throughout small and probably<lb/>Labrador. Here and there, I saw a sprinkling of iron-pyrites.<lb/>The whole belongs probably to the black augite-porphyry, as<lb/>well as the whole formation of Chimborazo, of which we shall<lb/>speak further on, and to which I am not disposed to give the<lb/>name trachyte, since it contains no felspar, (with some albite),<lb/>such as is contained in our trachyte of the Siebengebirge near<lb/><pb n="296" facs="#f0006" />
Bonn. The slaggy masses of the Yana-Urcu altered by a very<lb/>active fire, are indeed extremely light, but proper pumice-<lb/>stone has not been thrown out there. The eruption has taken<lb/>place through a grey, irregularly stratified mass of dolerite,<lb/>which here forms the table-land, and resembles the rock of<lb/>Penipe (at the foot of the volcano of Tungurahua) where<lb/>syenite and mica-slate containing garnets, have been broken<lb/>through. On the eastern side of the Yana-Urcu, or rather at<lb/>the foot of the hill towards Lican, the natives conducted us to<lb/>a projecting rock, an opening in which resembled the mouth of<lb/>a forsaken gallery. Here, as well as at the distance of ten feet,<lb/>there is heard a violent subterranean noise, which is accom-<lb/>panied by a current of air, or subterranean wind. The cur-<lb/>rent of air is much too weak to admit of the noise being attri-<lb/>buted to it. The noise certainly arises from a subterranean<lb/>brook, which is precipitated downwards into a deep hollow,<lb/>and through its fall occasions a motion in the air. A monk, the<lb/>priest at Calpi, had, with the same idea, some time before, con-<lb/>tinued on the gallery at an open fissure to procure water for<lb/>his village. The hardness of the black augite rock probably<lb/>interrupted the work. Chimborazo, notwithstanding its enor-<lb/>mous mass of snow, sends down into the table-land such insig-<lb/>nificant brooks of water, that it may be presumed the greater<lb/>part of its water flows through clefts to the interior. In the<lb/>village of Calpi itself also, there was formerly heard a great<lb/>noise in a house that had no cellar. Before the celebrated<lb/>earthquake of the 4th February 1797, there sprang forth a<lb/>brook in the south-west of the village, at a deeper point. Many<lb/>Indians considered this brook as a part of the water that flows<lb/>under the Yana-Urcu. But since the great earthquake, this<lb/>brook has again disappeared.</p><lb/><p>After we had passed the night at Calpi, which, according to<lb/>my barometrical measurement, lies 9720 feet (1620 toises)<lb/>above the sea, we began, on the morning of the 23d, our pro-<lb/>per expedition up Chimborazo. We attempted to ascend the<lb/>mountain on the SS. E. side, and the Indians who were to at-<lb/>tend us as guides, but of whom but a few had ever reached the<lb/>limit of perpetual snow, gave this course the preference. We<lb/>found Chimborazo surrounded with great plains, which rise,<lb/><pb n="297" facs="#f0007" />
    step-like, one above the other. Proceeding first through the<lb/>Llanos de Luisa, then after rather a gradual ascent of scarcely<lb/>5000 feet in length, we reached the table land (Llano) of Sis-<lb/>gun. The first step (stufe) is at a height of 10,200 feet, the se-<lb/>cond 11,700. These grass grown plains thus equal in eleva-<lb/>tion, respectively, the highest summit of the Pyrenees (Peak<lb/>Nethou) and the summit of the Peak of Teneriffe. The per-<lb/>fect horizontality of these table-lands allows us to infer the<lb/>long continuance of stagnant water. The traveller imagines he<lb/>sees before him the bottom of a lake. On the acclivity of the<lb/>Swiss Alps, there is sometimes observed this phenomenon of<lb/>small step-like plains, lying one above the other, which, like<lb/>the emptied basins of alpine lakes, are united by narrow open<lb/>passes. The widely extended grass lands (los Pajonales) are<lb/>on Chimborazo, as everywhere around the high summits of<lb/>the Andes, so monotonous that the family of the grasses (species<lb/>of Paspalum, Andropogon, Bromus, Dejeuxia, Stipa) are sel-<lb/>dom interrupted by dicotyledonous plants. There prevails al-<lb/>most the heathy scenery which I have seen in the barren part<lb/>of Northern Asia. The flora of Chimborazo, in general, ap-<lb/>peared to us less rich than that of the other snow mountains<lb/>which surround the city of Quito. But a few Calceolari&#x00E6;, Com-<lb/>posit&#x00E6;, (Bidens, Eupatorium, Dumerilia paniculata, Werneria<lb/>nubigena) and Gentian&#x00E6;, among which the beautiful Gentiana<lb/>cernua shining forth with purple flowers,&#x2014;rear themselves on<lb/>the high plain of Sisgun, between the associated grasses. These<lb/>belong, for the most part, to the genera of Northern Europe.<lb/>The temperature of the air generally prevailing in these regions<lb/>of alpine grasses, elevated respectively 1600 and 2000 toises,<lb/>fluctuates by day between 4° and 16° C. (39°.2 and 60°.8 F.),<lb/>by night between 0° and 10° (32° and 50° F.). The mean<lb/>temperature of the whole year, according to my collective ob-<lb/>servations in the neighbourhood of the Equator, appears to be<lb/>about 9° <note place="foot" n="*">All temperatures mentioned in this paper are expressed in degrees of the<lb/>centigrade thermometer. (The equivalent degree of Fahrenheit have been<lb/>since added.&#x2014;T<hi rendition="#k">R</hi>.)</note> (48°.2 F.). In the flat lands of the Temperate<lb/>Zone, this is the mean temperature of the north of Germany,<lb/><pb n="298" facs="#f0008" />
for example, of Luneburg (Lat. 53°15&#x2032;); but here the distri-<lb/>bution of heat among the different months (the most important<lb/>element in determining the character of the vegetation of a<lb/>country) is so unequal, that in February, the mean heat is<lb/>&#x2014;1°.8 (+28°.76 F.), in July + 18° (+ 64°.4 F.)</p><lb/><p>My plan was to perform a trigonometrical operation in the<lb/>beautiful perfectly level grass land of Sisgun. I had made arrange-<lb/>ments for measuring a base line here. The angles of altitude<lb/>would have proved very considerable in such proximity to the<lb/>summit of Chimborazo. There remained yet a perpendicular<lb/>height of less than 8400 feet (the height of the Canigou in the<lb/>Pyrenees) to determine. Yet with the enormous masses of single<lb/>mountains in the chain of the Andes, every determination of the<lb/>height above the sea is compounded of a barometrical and trigo-<lb/>nometrical observation. I had taken with me the sextant and<lb/>other instruments of measurement in vain. The summit of<lb/>Chimborazo remained densely veiled in mist. From the high<lb/>plain of Sisgun the ascent is tolerably steep as far as the little<lb/>alpine lake of Yana-Coche. Thus far I had remained on the<lb/>mule, having from time to time alighted with my travelling com-<lb/>panion M. Bonpland merely to collect plants. Yana-Coche<lb/>does not deserve the name of a lake. It is a circular basin of<lb/>scarcely 130 feet in diameter. The sky became more and more<lb/>obscured; but between and over the mist-strata there still lay<lb/>scattered single groups of clouds. The summit of Chimborazo<lb/>was visible for a few moments only at a time. Much snow<lb/>having fallen during the preceding night, I left the mule where<lb/>we found the lower border of this newly-fallen snow, a border<lb/>which must not be confounded with the limit of perpetual snow.<lb/>The barometer shewed that we had only now attained the height<lb/>of 13,500 feet. On other mountains, likewise near to the equa-<lb/>tor, I have seen snow fall at the height of 11,200 feet, but not<lb/>lower. My companion rode as far as the line of perpetual snow,<lb/><hi rendition="#i">i. e.</hi> to the height of Mont Blanc; which mountain, as is known,<lb/>would not in this latitude (1° 27&#x2032; south) always be covered with<lb/>snow. The horses and mules remained there to await our re-<lb/>turn.</p><lb/><p>A hundred and fifty toises above the little basin of Yana-<lb/>Coche, we saw at length naked rock. Hitherto the grass-land<lb/><pb n="299" facs="#f0009" />
had withdrawn the ground from any geognostical examination.<lb/>Great walls of rocks, extending from the N. E. towards the<lb/>S. W., in part cleft into misshapen columns, reared themselves<lb/>out of the eternal snow,&#x2014;a brownish-black augite rock shining<lb/>like pitch-stone porphyry. The columns were very thin, per-<lb/>haps fifty to sixty feet in height, almost like the trachyte co-<lb/>lumns of Tabla Umca on the volcano Pichincha. One group<lb/>stood alone, and reminded one of masts and stems of trees. The<lb/>steep walls led us through the snow region to a narrow ridge of<lb/>rock extending towards the summit, by which alone it was pos-<lb/>sible for us to advance any farther; for the snow was then so<lb/>soft that one scarcely dared to tread upon its surface. The<lb/>ridge consisted of very weathered crumbling rock. It was often<lb/>vesicular like a basaltic-amygdaloid.</p><lb/><p>The path became more and more narrow and steep. The na-<lb/>tives forsook us all but one at the height of 15,600 feet. All<lb/>entreaties and threats were unavailing. The Indians maintain-<lb/>ed that they suffered more than we did from breathlessness.<lb/>We remained alone, Bonpland,&#x2014;our amiable friend the<lb/>younger son of the Marquis of Selvalegre, Carlos Montufar,<lb/>who, in the subsequent struggle for freedom, was shot, (at the<lb/>command of General Morillo),&#x2014;a Mestize from the neighbour-<lb/>ing village of San Juan,&#x2014;and myself. We attained, with great<lb/>exertion and endurance, a greater height than we had dared<lb/>hope to reach, as we were almost entirely wrapped in mist.<lb/>The ridge (very significantly called, in Spanish, Cuchilla, as it<lb/>were the knife-back) was in many places only eight to ten<lb/>inches broad. On the left the precipice was concealed by snow,<lb/>the surface of the latter seeming glazed with frost. The thin icy<lb/>mirror-like surface had an inclination of about 30°. On the<lb/>right our view sank shuddering 800 or 1000 feet into an<lb/>abyss out of which projected, perpendicularly, snowless masses<lb/>of rock. We held the body continually inclined towards this<lb/>side, for the precipice upon the left seemed still more threaten-<lb/>ing, because there no chance presented itself of grasping the<lb/>toothed rock, and because, further, the thin ice-crust offered no<lb/>security, against sinking in the loose snow. Only extremely<lb/>light porous bits of dolerite could we roll down this crust of<lb/>ice; and the inclined plane of snow was so extended that we lost<lb/><pb n="300" facs="#f0010" />
sight of the stones thus rolled down before they came to rest.<lb/>The absence of snow, as well upon the ridge along which we<lb/>ascended, as upon the rocks on our right hand towards the east,<lb/>cannot be ascribed so much to the steepness of the masses, and<lb/>to the gales of wind, as to open clefts, which breathe out warm<lb/>air from deeper situated beds. We soon found our further<lb/>ascent more difficult, from the increase of the crumbling nature<lb/>of the rock. At single and very steep <hi rendition="#i">échélons</hi> it was necessary<lb/>to apply at the same time the hands and feet, as is so usual in<lb/>all alpine journeys. As the rock was very keenly angular, we<lb/>were painfully hurt, especially in the hands. Leopold Von<lb/>Buch and I suffered very much in this manner near the crater<lb/>of the Peak of Teneriffe, which abounds in obsidian. I had<lb/>had besides (if it be permitted a traveller to mention such unim-<lb/>portant particulars) for several weeks a sore in the foot, occasioned<lb/>by the accumulations of Niguas <note place="foot" n="*">The Sand-flea, the Chique of the French colonists of the West Indies,<lb/>an insect that introduces itself under the human skin, and, as the ovary of the<lb/>impregnated female considerably enlarges, inflammation is excited.</note> (<hi rendition="#i">Pulex penetrans</hi>), and much<lb/>increased by fine dust of pumice-stone during measurements in<lb/>Llano de Tapia. The little adhesion of the rocks upon the ridge<lb/>now rendered greater caution necessary, as many masses which we<lb/>supposed firm lay loose and covered with sand. We proceeded<lb/>one after the other, and so much the more slowly, as it was need-<lb/>ful to try the places which seemed uncertain. Happily the at-<lb/>tempt to reach the summit of Chimborazo was the last of our<lb/>mountain journeys in South America; hence previous experi-<lb/>ence guided us, and gave us more confidence in our powers.<lb/>It is a peculiar character of all excursions in the Andes, that<lb/>above the snow-line white people find themselves in the most<lb/>perilous situations, always without guides, indeed without any<lb/>knowledge of localities.</p><lb/><p>We could see the summit no longer, even for a moment only<lb/>at a time, and were hence doubly curious to know, how much<lb/>higher it remained for us to ascend. We examined the baro-<lb/>meter at a point where the breadth of the ridge permitted<lb/>of two persons standing conveniently together. We were now<lb/>at an elevation of 17,300 feet; thus scarcely two hundred<lb/><pb n="301" facs="#f0011" />
    feet higher than we had been two months before, when climb-<lb/>ing a similar ridge on the Antisana. It is with the deter-<lb/>mining of heights in climbing mountains, as with the determin-<lb/>ing of temperature in the heat of summer. One finds with vex-<lb/>ation the thermometer not so high, the barometer not so low,<lb/>as one expected. As the air, notwithstanding the height, was<lb/>quite saturated with moisture, we now found the loose rock and<lb/>the sand that filled its interstices extremely wet. The air was<lb/>still 2° 8&#x2032; (37° 04&#x2032; Fahr.)<choice><sic></sic><corr type="editorial">.</corr></choice> Shortly before, we had in a dry place<lb/>been able to bury the thermometer three inches deep in the<lb/>sand. It indicated + 5° 8&#x2032; (+ 42° 44&#x2032; Fahr.)<choice><sic></sic><corr type="editorial">.</corr></choice> The result of<lb/>this observation, which was made at the height of about 2860<lb/>toises, is very remarkable, for 400 toises lower down, at the li-<lb/>mit of perpetual snow, the mean heat of the atmosphere is, ac-<lb/>cording to many observations, carefully collected by Boussin-<lb/>gault and myself, only + 1° 6&#x2032; (34° 88&#x2032; Fahr.)<choice><sic></sic><corr type="editorial">.</corr></choice> The tempera-<lb/>ture of earth (sand) at + 5° 8&#x2032; (42° 44&#x2032; Fahr.) must therefore<lb/>be ascribed to the subterranean heat of the dolerite mountain;<lb/>I do not say to the whole mass, but to the current of air ascend-<lb/>ing from the interior.</p><lb/><p>After an hour of cautious climbing, the ridge of rock became<lb/>less steep; but alas! the mist remained as thick as ever. We<lb/>now began gradually to suffer from great nausea. The tenden-<lb/>cy to vomiting was combined with some giddiness; and much<lb/>more troublesome than the difficulty of breathing. A coloured<lb/>man (a mestize of San Juan), not from selfish motives, but merely<lb/>out of good nature, had been unwilling to forsake us. He was<lb/>a poor vigorous peasant, and suffered more than we did. We<lb/>had h&#x00E6;morrhage from the gums and lips. The conjunctiva of<lb/>the eyes likewise, was, in all, gorged with blood. These symp-<lb/>toms of extravasation in the eyes, and of oozing from the lips<lb/>and gums, did not in the least disquiet us, as we had repeatedly<lb/>experienced them before. In Europe, M. Zumstein began to ex-<lb/>perience h&#x00E6;morrhage at a much lower elevation on Monte Rosa.<lb/>The Spanish warriors during the conquest of the equinoctial re-<lb/>gion of America (during the Conquista), did not ascend above the<lb/>snow line, thus but little above the elevation of Mont Blanc, and<lb/>yet Acosta, in his <hi rendition="#i">Historia Natural de las Indias</hi>,&#x2014;a kind of<lb/>physical geography, which may be called a master-piece of the<lb/>16th century,&#x2014;speaks circumstantially of &#x201C;Nausea and Spasm<lb/><pb n="302" facs="#f0012" />
of the Stomach,&#x201D; as painful symptoms of the <hi rendition="#i">mountain-sickness</hi>,<lb/>which in these respects is analogous to <hi rendition="#i">sea-sickness</hi>. On the<lb/>volcano of Pichincha I once felt, without experiencing h&#x00E6;mor-<lb/>rhage, so violent an affection of the stomach, accompanied by<lb/>giddiness, that I was found senseless on the ground, just as I<lb/>left my companions on a wall of rock above the defile of Verde-<lb/>Cucha, in order to perform some electrical experiments on a per-<lb/>fectly open space. The height was inconsiderable, below 13,800<lb/>feet. But on the Antisana, at the considerable elevation of<lb/>17,220 feet, our young travelling companion, Don Carlos Mon-<lb/>tufar, bled freely from the lips. All of these phenomena vary<lb/>according to age, constitution, the tenderness of the skin, the<lb/>preceding exertions of the muscular powers; yet for single indivi-<lb/>duals they are a kind of measure of the atmospheric tenuity, and<lb/>of the absolute elevation reached. According to my observations<lb/>in the Cordilleras, these symptoms manifest themselves in white<lb/>people, with a mercurial column between 14 inches,&#x2014;and 15<lb/>inches 10 lines. It is known that the estimates regarding<lb/>heights, which &#x00E6;ronauts maintain that they have reached, gene-<lb/>rally deserve but little credit, and if a more certain and extremely<lb/>accurate observer, M. Gay Lussac, who, on the 16th of Sep-<lb/>tember 1804, reached the vast height of 21,600 feet (thus between<lb/>the height of Chimborazo and Illimani), experienced no h&#x00E6;mor-<lb/>rhage, this is perhaps to be ascribed to the absence of muscular<lb/>exertion. According to the present condition of eudiometry,<lb/>the air of those lofty regions appear to contain in proportion as<lb/>much oxygen as that of lower heights; but since in that attenu-<lb/>ated air&#x2014;the barometric pressure only one-half of that to which<lb/>we are generally exposed&#x2014;the blood in each act of respiration<lb/>takes up a smaller quantity of oxygen, it is certainly conceivable<lb/>that a general feeling of weakness should take place. Why this<lb/>asthenie as in fainting, should excite nausea and a tendency<lb/>to vomiting, it is not our purpose to determine; as little is it<lb/>here to be proved, that the oozing of blood (the h&#x00E6;morrhage<lb/>from the lips, gums, and eyes), which also has not been expe-<lb/>rienced by all, at such great heights,&#x2014;can by no means be sa-<lb/>tisfactorily explained by the absence of a &#x201C;mechanical counter-<lb/>pressure&#x201D; on the vascular system; our attention should rather<lb/>be engaged in examining the probability of the influence of a<lb/><pb n="303" facs="#f0013" />
diminished atmospheric pressure, during fatigue, on the moving<lb/>of the legs in regions of very attenuated air; for, according to<lb/>the memorable discovery of two spirited inquirers, Wilhelm and<lb/>Edward Weber,<note place="foot" n="*"><hi rendition="#i">Mechanik der Menschlichen Gehwerkzeuge.</hi> 1836. § 64. S. 147&#x2013;160.<lb/>More recent experiments of the brothers Weber, at Berlin, have fully con-<lb/>firmed the position, that the leg is carried in the acetabulum by the pressure<lb/>of the atmosphere.</note> the hovering leg, hanging from the trunk, is<lb/>held and carried merely by the pressure of the atmosphere.</p><lb/><p>The layers of mist that prevented our seeing distant objects,<lb/>appeared suddenly, notwithstanding the total stillness of the<lb/>air, perhaps through electrical processes, to be broken up. We<lb/>recognised once more, and indeed immediately before us, the<lb/>dome-shaped summit of Chimborazo. It was an earnest, mo-<lb/>mentous gaze. The hope to reach this summit animated our<lb/>powers anew. The ridge of rock, only here and there covered<lb/>with thin flakes of snow, became somewhat broader. We hastened<lb/>onwards, with certain steps, when all at once a ravine of some<lb/>400 feet in depth, and 50 broad, set an insurmountable barrier<lb/>to our undertaking. We saw distinctly beyond the abyss, our<lb/>ridge of rock continued forward in the same direction; yet I<lb/>doubt its leading to the summit itself. The chasm was not to<lb/>be gone round. On the Antisana, M. Bonpland indeed had<lb/>found it possible, after a very cold night, to proceed for a con-<lb/>siderable length through the snow. We durst not venture the<lb/>attempt, because of the looseness of the mass, and the form of<lb/>the precipice rendered climbing down impossible. It was one<lb/>o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon. We set up with much care the baro-<lb/>meter. It indicated 13 inches 11 <formula notation="TeX">\frac{2}{10}</formula> lines. The temperature<lb/>of the air was now &#x2014; 1° 6&#x2032; (+ 29° 12&#x2032; F.), but after several<lb/>years&#x2019; stay in the hottest regions of the Tropics, this small de-<lb/>gree of cold benumbed us. Besides, our boots were thoroughly<lb/>soaked with snow-water, for the sand that covered here and<lb/>there the ridge was mixed with old snow. According to La<lb/>Place&#x2019;s barometrical formula, we had reached a height of 3016<lb/>toises, or more precisely 18,097 Paris feet. If La Condamine&#x2019;s<lb/>estimate of the height of Chimborazo, as noted on the stone-<lb/>table of the Jesuit&#x2019;s College in Quito, be correct, there failed us<lb/><pb n="304" facs="#f0014" />
yet of the summit of the mountain 1224 feet, or thrice the<lb/>height of St Peter&#x2019;s church at Rome.</p><lb/><p>La Condamine and Bouguer say explicitly, that they attained,<lb/>on Chimborazo, the height of 2400 toises only; but they glory<lb/>in having seen on the Corazon,&#x2014;one of the most picturesque<lb/>snow-mountains (Nevados) in the immediate neighbourhood of<lb/>Quito,&#x2014;the barometer at 15 inches 10 lines. They say this is<lb/>&#x201C;a lower state than any human being has hitherto ever been<lb/>in a situation to observe.&#x201D; At the above described point on<lb/>Chimborazo, the pressure of the air was about two inches less;<lb/>less also than at the highest point reached in 1818, sixteen years<lb/>afterwards, by Captain Gerard, on the Tarhigang, in the Him-<lb/>malayan Mountains. I have been exposed in a diving-bell in<lb/>England to an air-pressure of forty-five inches, for almost an<lb/>hour together. The flexibility of the human organism conse-<lb/>quently endures changes in the state of the barometer, amount-<lb/>ing to thirty-one inches. Yet the physical constitution of the<lb/>human race might be remarkably changed, if great cosmical<lb/>causes were to make permanent such extremes in atmospheric<lb/>tenuity and condensation.</p><lb/><p>We remained but a short time in this mournful solitude, being<lb/>soon again entirely veiled in mist. The humid air was not thereby<lb/>set in motion. No fixed direction was to be observed in single<lb/>groups of the denser particles of vapour; I therefore cannot say<lb/>whether at this elevation the west wind blows, opposing the<lb/>Tropical monsoon. We saw no longer the summit of Chimbo-<lb/>razo, none of the neighbouring snow-mountains, still less the<lb/>table-lands of Quito. We were as though isolated in a ball of<lb/>air. Some stone-lichens only had followed us above the line of<lb/>perpetual snow. The last cryptogamic plants which I col-<lb/>lected were Lecidea atrovirens (Lichen geographicus, <hi rendition="#i">Web</hi>.),<lb/>and a Gyrophora of <hi rendition="#i">Acharius</hi>, a new species (Gyrophora ru-<lb/>gosa), at about the height of 2820 toises. The last moss, Grim-<lb/>mia longirostris, grew 400 toises lower down. A butterfly<lb/>(sphinx) was caught by M. Bonpland at the height of 15,000<lb/>feet; we saw a fly 1600 feet higher. The following facts afford<lb/>the most striking proof that these animals are involuntarily car-<lb/>ried up into those upper regions by the current of air which<lb/>rises from the warmed plains. As Boussingault ascended the<lb/><pb n="305" facs="#f0015" />
Silla de Caracas, to repeat my measurement of the mountain,<lb/>he saw from time to time, at the height of 8000 feet, at noon,<lb/>as the west wind blew, whitish bodies rapidly pass through the<lb/>air, which he at first took for soaring birds with white plumage,<lb/>that reflected the sun&#x2019;s rays. These bodies rose with great ra-<lb/>pidity out of the valley of Caracas, and surmounting the summit<lb/>of Silla, took a north-east direction, and reached probably the<lb/>sea. Some fell upon the southern acclivity of the Silla; they<lb/>were grass-halms, that had reflected the sun&#x2019;s rays. Boussin-<lb/>gault sent me some of these, which still had ears, in a letter to<lb/>Paris, where my friend and fellow-labourer Kunth instantly<lb/>recognised them as the Wilfa tenacissima, which grows in the<lb/>valley of Caracas, and which he has described in our work,<lb/><hi rendition="#i">Nova Genera et Species Plantarum Americ&#x00E6; &#x00C6;quinoctialis</hi>.<lb/>I must remark, that we met with no condor on Chimborazo, that<lb/>powerful vulture, which is so frequent on Antisana and Pich-<lb/>incha, and which shews great confidence from its ignorance of<lb/>man. The condor loves pure air, in order the easier from on<lb/>high to recognise its prey or its food, for it gives dead animals<lb/>the preference.</p><lb/><p>As the weather became more and more cloudy, we hastened<lb/>down upon the same ledge of rock, that had favoured our ascent.<lb/>Caution, however, on account of the uncertainty of the steps,<lb/>was more necessary than in climbing up. We tarried only just<lb/>to collect fragments of rock. We foresaw, that in Europe &#x201C;a<lb/>little bit of Chimborazo&#x201D; would be asked for. At that time, no<lb/>mountain rock in any part of South America had been named;<lb/>the rocks of all the high summits of the Andes were called gra-<lb/>nite. As we were at the height of about 17,400 feet, it began<lb/>to hail violently. The hailstones were opaque, and milk-white,<lb/>with concentric layers. Some appeared considerably flattened<lb/>by rotation, twenty minutes before we reached the lower limit<lb/>of perpetual snow, the hail was replaced by snow. The flakes<lb/>were so dense, that the snow soon covered the ridge of rock many<lb/>inches deep; we should have been brought into great danger,<lb/>had the snow surprised us at the height of 18,000 feet. At a<lb/>few minutes after two o&#x2019;clock, we reached the point where our<lb/>mules were standing. The natives that remained behind, had<lb/>been very apprehensive for our safety.</p><lb/><pb n="306" facs="#f0016" />
        <p>That part of our expedition which lay above the snow-line, had<lb/>lasted only 3<formula notation="TeX">\frac{1}{2}</formula> hours, during which, notwithstanding the tenuity<lb/>of the air, we had not found it needful to take rest by sitting down.<lb/>The diameter of the dome-shaped summit at the snow-line&#x2014;<hi rendition="#i">i. e.</hi><lb/>at the height of 2460 toises&#x2014;amounts to 3437 toises, and near<lb/>the apex, about 150 toises below the same, the diameter is<lb/>672 toises. The last number is thus the diameter of the up-<lb/>per part of the dome or bell; the first expresses the breadth,<lb/>of which the whole snow-mass of Chimborazo appears to the<lb/>eye, as seen from Rio Nuevo; a mass which, together with the<lb/>two mountain-tops lying to the north, is represented in the 16th<lb/>and 25th table of my engraved work, <hi rendition="#i">Vues des Cordillères.</hi> I<lb/>have carefully measured with the sextant, the single parts of the<lb/>contour, as the latter, on a clear day, magnificently stands forth<lb/>in opposition to the deep-blue of a tropical sky. Such observa-<lb/>tions assist in thoroughly exploring the volume of this colossus,<lb/>in so far as it surmounts a plain, in which Bonguer performed<lb/>his experiments on the attraction of the mountain for a pendu-<lb/>lum. A distinguished geognost, M. Pentland, to whom we are<lb/>indebted for a knowledge of the heights of Sorata and Illimani,<lb/>and who, furnished with excellent instruments for astronomical<lb/>and physical research, is now again going to upper Peru (Boli-<lb/>via) has assured me, that my figure of Chimborazo is, as it<lb/>were, repeated in the Nevado de Chuquibamba, a trachyte moun-<lb/>tain of the Western Cordilleras, north of Arequipa, having a<lb/>height of 19,680 feet (3280 toises). Next to the Himmalayan<lb/>mountains, this is, owing to the frequency of high summits<lb/>and the mass of the same, between the 15th and 18th degree of<lb/>south latitude the greatest enlargement on the earth&#x2019;s surface, with<lb/>which we are acquainted, in so far namely, as this enlargement<lb/>proceeds, not from the primitive form of the revolving planet,<lb/>but from the elevation of mountain-chains and single domes of<lb/>dolerite, trachyte, and albite rock, within these mountain-chains.</p><lb/><p>On account of the snow newly fallen, we found in our de-<lb/>cent from Chimborazo, the lower limit of perpetual snow, in<lb/>accidental and temporary conjunction with the deeper sporadial<lb/>spots of snow on the naked lichen-covered rocks, and on the<lb/>grass plain (Pajonal); yet it was always easy to recognise the<lb/>proper limit of perpetual snow (then at the height of 2470 toises)<lb/>by the thickness of the bed and by its peculiar state. I have<lb/><pb n="307" facs="#f0017" />
shewn, in another place (in a treatise on the causes which con-<lb/>ditionate the curvature of <hi rendition="#i">isothermal lines</hi> incorporated into one<lb/>of the <hi rendition="#i">fragmens Asiatique</hi>), that in the province of Quito, the<lb/>differences in height of the snow-line on the different <hi rendition="#i">Nevados</hi>,<lb/>according to the sum-total of my measurements, varies only<lb/>about 38 toises,&#x2014;that the mean height itself is to be reckoned<lb/>14,760 feet, or 2460 toises,&#x2014;and that this limit in Bolivia, 16°<lb/>to 18° south of the equator, on account of the relation of the<lb/>mean annual temperature to the mean temperature of the hot-<lb/>test months, on account of the mass, extent, and greater height<lb/>of the surrounding heat-radiating <hi rendition="#i">plateaus</hi>, on account of the<lb/>dryness of the atmosphere, and the complete absence of any fall-<lb/>ing snow between March and November, lies at a height of full<lb/>26,780 toises. The lower limit of perpetual snow, which by no<lb/>means coincides with the isothermal curve of 0°, rises consequent-<lb/>ly higher, as an exception, instead of falling, as one recedes from<lb/>the equator. From quite analogous causes of the radiation of heat<lb/>in neighbouring table-lands, the snow-line lies between 30<formula notation="TeX">\frac{3}{4}</formula>° and<lb/>31° of northern latitude, on the northern Thibet side of the<lb/>Himmalayan range, at the height of 2600 toises; while on the<lb/>southern Indian side, it reaches the height of only 1950 toises.<lb/>Through this remarkable influence of the shape of the earth&#x2019;s<lb/>surface, a considerable part of inner Asia, beyond the Tropics,<lb/>is inhabited by an agricultural population, who, though monk-<lb/>governed, are advanced in civilization; where in South Ame-<lb/>rica, under the equator, the ground is covered with eternal ice.</p><lb/><p>We took a somewhat more northern way back to the village<lb/>of Calpi than the Llanas de Sisgum, through the Paramo de<lb/>Pungupala, a district rich in plants. By five o&#x2019;clock in the<lb/>evening we were again with the friendly clergyman of Calpi.<lb/>As usual, the misty day of the expedition was succeeded by the<lb/>clearest weather. On the 25th of June, at Riobamba Nuevo,<lb/>Chimborazo presented itself in all its splendour,&#x2014;I may say, in<lb/>the calm greatness and supremacy which is the natural charac-<lb/>ter of the tropical landscape. A second attempt upon a ridge<lb/>interrupted by a chasm, would certainly have turned out as<lb/>fruitless as the first, and I was already engaged with the trigo-<lb/>nometrical measurement of the volcano of Tungurahua.</p><lb/><pb n="308" facs="#f0018" />
<p>Boussingault, on the 16th of December 1831, with his Eng-<lb/>lish friend Colonel Hall,&#x2014;who was soon afterwards assassinat-<lb/>ed in Quito,&#x2014;made a new attempt to reach the summit of Chim-<lb/>borazo, first from Mocha and Chillapullu, then from Arenal,<lb/>thus by a different way from that trodden by Bonpland, Don<lb/>Carlos Montufar, and myself. He was obliged to give up the<lb/>ascent, when his barometer indicated 13 inches 8<formula notation="TeX">\frac{1}{2}</formula> lines, with<lb/>an atmospheric temperature of + 7°.8 (+ 46°.04 F.). He<lb/>thus saw the uncorrected column of mercury almost three lines<lb/>lower, and reached a point 64 toises higher than I did, viz. 3080<lb/>toises. Let us have the words of this well-known traveller of<lb/>the Andes, who was the first to carry a chemical apparatus to,<lb/>and into, the craters of volcanoes. &#x201C;The way,&#x201D; says Boussin-<lb/>gault, &#x201C;which we opened for ourselves through the snow, in<lb/>the latter part of our expedition, permitted of our advancing<lb/>but very slowly. On the right we were enabled to grasp hold<lb/>of a rock, on the left, the abyss was fearful. We were already<lb/>sensible of the effect of the attenuated air, and were obliged,<lb/>every two or three steps, to sit down. As soon, however, as we<lb/>were seated, we again stood up, for our sufferings lasted only<lb/>while we moved. The snow we were obliged to tread was soft,<lb/>and lay three or four inches deep, on a very smooth and hard<lb/>covering of ice. We were obliged to hew out steps. A Negro<lb/>went before, to perform this work, by which his powers were<lb/>soon exhausted. As I was endeavouring to pass him, for the<lb/>purpose of relieving him, I slipped, and happily was held back by<lb/>Colonel Hall and my Negro. We were (adds M. Boussingault)<lb/>for a moment all three in the greatest danger. Further on, the<lb/>snow became more favourable, and at three quarters past three<lb/>o&#x2019;clock we stood upon the long-looked for ridge of rock, which<lb/>was only a few feet broad, and surrounded by immeasurable<lb/>depths. Here we became convinced that to advance farther was<lb/>impossible. We found ourselves at the foot of a prism of rock,<lb/>whose upper surface, covered with a cap of snow, forms the pro-<lb/>per summit of Chimborazo. To have a true figure of the topo-<lb/>graphy of the whole mountain, one must imagine an enormous<lb/>snow-covered mass of rock, which from all sides appears as if<lb/>supported by buttresses. The latter are the ridges, which, ad-<lb/><pb n="309" facs="#f0019" />
    herent, project through the eternal snow.&#x201D; The loss of a na-<lb/>tural philosopher, like Boussingault, would have been inde-<lb/>scribably dearly-bought with the little gain which undertakings<lb/>of this sort can afford to science.</p><lb/><p>Although, thirty years ago, I expressed the wish that the<lb/>height of Chimborazo might be again trigonometrically mea-<lb/>sured, there yet remains some uncertainty as to the abso-<lb/>lute result. Don Jorge Juan and the French Academicians,<lb/>after different combinations of the same elements, or at least<lb/>after operations, the whole of which were in common, give the<lb/>heights of 3380 and 3217 toises; heights which present a dif-<lb/>ference of <formula notation="TeX">\frac{1}{20}</formula>th. The result of my trigonometrical operation<lb/>(3350 T.) falls between them, but approaches to within <formula notation="TeX">\frac{1}{112}</formula>th of<lb/>the Spanish estimate. Bouguer&#x2019;s lesser result is founded, in part<lb/>at least, upon the height of the city of Quito, which he esti-<lb/>mated at 30 to 40 toises too low. He gives, according to old<lb/>barometric formula, without correction for the temperature, the<lb/>height of 1462, instead of 1507 and 1492 toises, the very ac-<lb/>cordant results, respectively, of Boussingault&#x2019;s observations and<lb/>my own. The height at which I estimate the plain of Tapia,<lb/>where I measured a base of 873 toises in length, <note place="foot" n="*"><hi rendition="#i">Humboldt</hi>, Recueil d&#x2019;observations astronomiques d&#x2019;operations trigono-<lb/>metriques, etc. T. I. p. lxxii.</note> also appears<lb/>to be pretty free from error. I found the same to be 1482<lb/>toises; and Boussingault, at a very different season of the year,<lb/>and thus with other diminutions of temperature in the atmo-<lb/>spheric strata, 1471 toises. Bouguer&#x2019;s operation was, on the<lb/>other hand, very complicated, as he was obliged to estimate the<lb/>height of the valley-plain, between the eastern and western<lb/>Andes, by means of very small angles of height of the trachyte-<lb/>pyramid of Ilinissa, measured in the under region of the coast.<lb/>The only considerable mountain of the earth, of which the mea-<lb/>surements now agree within <formula notation="TeX">\frac{1}{246}</formula>th. is Mont Blanc; for Monte<lb/>Rosa was, with four different series of triangles by an excellent<lb/>observer, the astronomer <hi rendition="#i">Carlini</hi>, estimated at 2319, 2343,<lb/>2357, and 2374 toises; by <hi rendition="#i">Oriani</hi>, likewise by triangulation,<lb/>at 2390 toises; differences of <formula notation="TeX">\frac{1}{34}</formula>th. The oldest detailed men-<lb/>tion of Chimborazo, I find to be that of the spirited, somewhat<lb/><pb n="310" facs="#f0020" />
satyrical, Italian traveller, Girolamo Benzoni, whose work was<lb/>printed in 1565. He says, that the Montagna di Chimbo, 40<lb/><hi rendition="#i">miglia</hi> high, appeared to him strangely <hi rendition="#i">come una visione</hi>. The<lb/>natives of Quito knew, long before the arrival of the French<lb/>surveyors, that Chimborazo was the highest snow-mountain in<lb/>all their country. They saw that it ascended highest above the<lb/>line of perpetual snow. It was just this consideration that<lb/>induced them to consider the now fallen in Capac Urcu as<lb/>higher than Chimborazo.</p><lb/><p>Regarding the geognostical constitution of Chimborazo, I<lb/>here add only the general remark, that if, according to the im-<lb/>portant results which Leopold von Buch has laid down in his<lb/>classical memoir, &#x201C;On Craters of Elevation and Volcanoes,<note place="foot" n="*"><hi rendition="#i">Poggendorff&#x2019;s</hi> Annalen, Band. 37. S. 188&#x2014;190. Also Edinburgh New<lb/>Philosophical Journal, for translation of this memoir.</note>&#x201D;<lb/>Trachyte is a mass containing Felspar, and Andesite a mass<lb/>with imbedded Albite; the rock of Chimborazo is by no<lb/>means deserving of either name. That in Chimborazo, Augite<lb/>replaces Hornblende, the same intelligent geognost observed,<lb/>more than twenty years ago, when I requested him to ex-<lb/>amine, oryctognostically and with precision, the rocks brought<lb/>home by me from the Andes. This fact has been mentioned<lb/>in several parts of my &#x201C;<hi rendition="#i">Essai geognostique sur le Gisement<lb/>des Rochers dans les deux Hémisphères</hi>,&#x201D; which appeared in the<lb/>year 1823. Besides this, my Siberian travelling companion,<lb/><hi rendition="#i">Gustav Rose</hi>, who, by his excellent work on the minerals related<lb/>to felspar, and their association with augite and hornblende, has<lb/>opened new ways for geognostical research, finds in all my col-<lb/>lection of mountain-fragments from Chimborazo, neither albite<lb/>nor felspar. The whole formation of this celebrated summit of the<lb/>Andes, consists of labrador and augite; both fossils recognisable<lb/>in distinct crystals. Chimborazo is, according to the nomencla-<lb/>ture of <hi rendition="#i">Gustav Rose</hi>, an augite-porphyry, a species of dolerite.<lb/>Obsidian and pumice stone are also wanting in it. Hornblende<lb/>occurs very sparingly. Chimborazo is thus, as taught by<lb/>Leopold von Buch&#x2019;s and Elie de Beaumont&#x2019;s latest decisions,<lb/>analogous in its rock to Etna. With the ruins of the old city<lb/>of Riobamba, three geographical miles east of Chimborazo, there<lb/><pb n="311" facs="#f0021" />
is associated true diorite-porphyry, a mixture of black horn-<lb/>blende (without augite) and white glassy albite, a rock which<lb/>reminds one of the beautiful columnar masses of Pisoje near<lb/>Popayan, and of the Mexican volcano of Toluca; which also, I<lb/>ascended. Some of the pieces of augite-porphyry, which I found<lb/>as high up as 18,000 feet upon the ridge of rock leading to-<lb/>wards the summit, for the most part in loose pieces, of from 12<lb/>to 14 inches in diameter, are minutely porous, and red in colour.<lb/>These pieces have shining vesicular cavities. The blackest are<lb/>sometimes light, like pumice-stones, and as if recently changed by<lb/>fire. They have not, however, flown in streams like lava, but have<lb/>probably been thrust out through fissures, on the side of the earlier<lb/>raised-up dome-shaped mountain. The whole table-land of the<lb/>province of Quito has always been considered by me as a great<lb/>volcanic area. Tungurahua, Cotopaxi, Pichincha, with their<lb/>craters, are only different openings of this area. If volcanism,<lb/>in the broadest sense of the word, marks all the appearances<lb/>which depend on the reaction of the interior of a planet<lb/>on its oxydized surface, this part of the high land is more<lb/>exposed than any other in the tropical region of South Ame-<lb/>rica, to the effect of this volcanism. The volcanic powers<lb/>rage also, under the domes of augite-porphyry, which, like<lb/>that of Chimborazo, have no crater. Three days after our<lb/>expedition, we heard, in New Riobamba, at one o&#x2019;clock <hi rendition="#k">a. m.</hi>,<lb/>a raging subterranean crash <hi rendition="#i">(bramido)</hi> that was accompanied<lb/>by no concussion. Three hours later, there followed a vio-<lb/>lent earthquake, without any preceding noise. Similar <hi rendition="#i">bra-<lb/>midos</hi>, coming, as it is supposed, from Chimborazo, were per-<lb/>ceived some days before at Calpi. Nearer to this mountain-<lb/>Colossus, in the village of San Juan, they are extremely frequent.<lb/>They excite the attention of the natives no more, than distant<lb/>thunder out of a deeply-clouded sky does in our northern zone.</p><lb/><p>These are the few fugitive remarks on two ascents of Chim-<lb/>borazo, which I have allowed myself to communicate from an<lb/>unprinted journal. Where Nature is so mighty and so vast,<lb/>and our endeavours are purely scientific, the exhibition of any<lb/>ornament in language may well be spared.</p></div><lb/></body><back></back>
