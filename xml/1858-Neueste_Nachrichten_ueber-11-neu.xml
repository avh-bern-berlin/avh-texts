<div n="1"><head><hi rendition="#i">A LETTER FROM HUMBOLDT ON THE<lb/>DEATH OF BONPLAND.</hi></head><lb/><milestone unit="section" rendition="#hr"/><lb/>
<p>The Berlin correspondent of <hi rendition="#i">The Boston Journal</hi><lb/>sends the following
                    letter of Alexander von Humboldt,<lb/>on the recent death of Bonpland, his
                    junior by about<lb/>four years. Humboldt hoped he might not survive<lb/>the
                    warmest friend of his early years, but it seems to<lb/>be the destiny of this
                    venerable man to follow all his<lb/>friends to the grave, and to remain himself
                    the sole<lb/>representative of the times of his youth.</p><lb/><div n="2"><head><hi rendition="#k">humboldt&#x2019;s letter.</hi></head><lb/><p>Conscious of the deep sympathy of numerous friends<lb/>in the sorrow occasioned by the
                        wide-spread report of<lb/>the death of my dear, noble friend and
                        fellow-trav-<lb/>eler, Bonpland, I consider it my duty to give at
                        least<lb/>a brief notice of this event, for the particulars of<lb/>which I
                        am indebted to the kind services of Dr. Lalle-<lb/>mant, author of an
                        important paper on the diseases<lb/>of Europeans in the tropies. This
                        talented gentle-<lb/>man, after leaving the Austrian Royal Expedition
                        in<lb/>the frigate Novara, in February of this year, for the<lb/>purpose of
                        doing a kindness to myself, made the<lb/>journey from Rio Janeiro to Rio
                        Grande, and thence<lb/>by way of Porto Alegro through the former
                        Jesuit<lb/>Mission to San Borgia, under the erroneous impres-<lb/>sion that
                        Bonpland, who had gone there in 1831, was<lb/>still resident at that place.
                        I have received two letters<lb/>from Dr. Lallemant, one dated at San Borgia
                        on the<lb/>10th of April, the other written from the village
                        of<lb/>Umguaiana, after he had visited Bonpland at Santa<lb/>Ana. An
                        extended abstract of these letters having<lb/>been sent to the editor of the
                        widely-read and inter-<lb/>esting botanical jonrnal, the <hi rendition="#i"
                            >Bonplandia,</hi> in Hanover,<lb/>the following briefer extracts may
                        here suffice.</p><lb/><p>&#x201C;In San Borgia,&#x201D; writes Dr. Lallemant, &#x201C;I lived<lb/>with an intimate friend
                        of Bonpland, the Vicar Gray,<lb/>with whom I visited the garden of the
                        botanist, so<lb/>long cultivated with care, but now lying waste
                        and<lb/>desolate. It was near the close of the year 1857 that<lb/>the Vicar
                        last received letters from Bonpland, since<lb/>when intelligence had come of
                        his severe illness.<lb/>Letters of inquiry still remained unanswered,
                        and<lb/>notwithstanding the short distance between the<lb/>places, the
                        people of San Borgia were uncertain<lb/>whether I should find your fellow
                        travellers yet in<lb/>the land of the living. In 1853 Bonpland had
                        left<lb/>San Borgia and taken up his residence upon his<lb/>larger
                        plantation of Santa Ana, where he had long<lb/>occupied himself in the
                        cultivation of orange trees.<lb/>The residence of the aged scholar in the
                        Estancia<lb/>of Santa Ana, consists of two large buildings,<lb/>mere clay
                        walls, bound together by bamboo sticks<lb/>and a few beams, and thatched
                        with straw. These<lb/>buildings have doors, but no windows, the light
                        being<lb/>admitted through the chinks between the bam-<lb/>boo sticks.
                        Despite the deep furrows which an event-<lb/>ful life had engraven in the
                        beloved countenance, his<lb/>eye had not grown dim nor lost any of its
                            full-<lb break="hyph-yes"/>thoughted vivacity. But lively conversation, though<lb/>started by
                        himself, appeared to weary him much, and<lb/>he suffered severely from a
                        chronic affection of the<lb/>bladder. The privations he had so strangely
                        im-<lb/>posed upon himself are by no means in consequence<lb/>of poverty, or
                        of any necessity for abstinence, but of<lb/>long custom, great self-control,
                        and characteristic in-<lb/>dividuality. The Government of Corrientes has
                        pre-<lb/>sented to him an estate valued at 10,000 Spanish pias-<lb/>ters,
                        and he enjoys a French pension of 3,000 francs<lb/>a year. He has never made
                        the practice of medi-<lb/>cine a source of pecuniary profit to himself.
                        Though<lb/>universally revered, he loves the solitude, and espe-<lb/>cially
                        avoids all persons who might offer him assist-<lb/>ance or advice. His
                        scientific ardor has not yet<lb/>abated, and his collections and manuscripts
                        are depos-<lb/>ited in Corrientes, where he has founded a
                            national<lb/>museum.</p><lb/><p>&#x201C;On the following morning I found him visibly<lb/>worse, and sinking away. The night had
                        been a<lb/>painful one. I pressed him to tell me whether I<lb/>might not, in
                        some way, be of service to him. But<lb/>I fared no better than his other
                        friends&#x2014;he would ac-<lb/>cept of no assistence. How gladly would I
                        have per-<lb/>suaded him to return once more to civilized society!<lb/>But
                        I, too, felt with him that his time was past. He<lb/>belongs to the first
                        half of the nineteenth century,<lb/>not to the second. I think that your
                        friend himself<lb/>was moved when I took his wasted hands in mine
                        with<lb/>the <choice>
                            <sic>preseure</sic>
                            <corr type="editorial">pressure</corr>
                        </choice> of farewell. For three months now his<lb/>attendants have remarked
                        his failing <choice>
                            <sic>strengtb</sic>
                            <corr type="editorial">strength</corr>
                        </choice>, and<lb/>perhaps the old man had the same foreboding as
                        my-<lb/>self at parting, that I might be the last <choice>
                            <sic>embassador</sic>
                            <corr type="editorial">ambassador</corr>
                        </choice> of<lb/>European lineage who should penetrate the depths of<lb/>the
                        wilderness to offer him regard, love and thanks, in<lb/>the name of that
                        science which owes so much to his<lb/>labors. I mounted my horse and rode
                        northward<lb/>through the evergreen plains. No path showed my<lb/>way, no
                                guide disturbed me; I was alone with my <choice><sic>sor<lb/>rowful</sic><corr type="editorial">sor-<lb break="no"/>rowful</corr></choice> thoughts over the
                        departed Bonpland.</p><lb/><p>&#x201C;Yet how cheerful the last latter I received from<lb/>Bonpland, bearing date the 7th of June, 1857! &#x2018;I<lb/>myself,&#x2019; he writes, &#x2018;shall bring all my collections and<lb/>&#x2018;manuscripts to Paris, and deposit them in the Muse-<lb/>&#x2018;um. My journey to France will be exceedingly short.<lb/>&#x2018;I shall return to my Santa Ana, where I lead a quiet<lb/>&#x2018;and happy life. Here shall I die, and my sepulchre<lb/>&#x2018;and my grave shall be underneath the shadow of the<lb/>&#x2018;many trees I have planted. Oh, how happy were I,<lb/>&#x2018;my dear Humboldt, could we meet once more, and<lb/>&#x2018;recall our common experiences! On the 28th of<lb/>&#x2018;August next I shall be eighty-four years old, and am<lb/>&#x2018;yet four years younger than you. A man lately died<lb/>&#x2018;in this vicinity who had attained the age of one hun-<lb/>&#x2018;dred and seven. What a prospect for two travelers<lb/>&#x2018;who have already stepped beyond the eightieth<lb/>&#x2018;year!&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><lb/><p>The cheering, almost life-desiring tone of this letter,<lb/>contrasts strangely with the
                        melancholy representa-<lb/>tions of Dr. Lallemant. According to Herr v.
                        Tschudi<lb/>the report was credited in Montevideo on the 29th of<lb/>May,
                        that Bonpland had died at Borgia, the date of<lb/>his death uncertain. Yet
                        Dr. Lallemant had spoken<lb/>with him on the 18th of April in Santa Ana, and
                        on<lb/>May 10 the report of his death was discredited at<lb/>Porto Allegro.
                        Thus there yet remains ground for<lb/>hope that the younger is not to be
                        first called away.<lb/>Such remoteness often stretches uncertainty to a
                        pain-<lb/>ful duration; such the solicitude felt for Edward Vogel<lb/>in
                        Central Africa, and for Adolphus Schlagintwait in<lb/>Central
                        Asia&#x2014;the sorrowfully missed!</p><lb/><dateline><hi rendition="#i">Berlin,</hi> July 12, 1858.</dateline><closer><salute><hi rendition="#et">ALEXANDER V. HUMBOLDT.</hi></salute></closer></div></div><lb/></body><back></back>
