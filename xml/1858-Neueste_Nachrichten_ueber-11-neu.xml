    <p><hi rendition="#k">The</hi> Berlin correspondent of the Boston <hi rendition="#i">Journal</hi> sends<lb/>the following letter of Alexander Von Humboldt, on the<lb/>recent death of Bonpland. His senior by about four<lb/>years, Humboldt hoped he might not survive the warm-<lb/>est friend of his early years, but it seems to be the destiny<lb/>of this venerable man to follow all his friends to the grave,<lb/>and to remain himself the sole representative of the times<lb/>of his youth.</p><lb/><div n="2">

                    <lb/>
                    <p>Conscious of the deep sympathy of numerous friends in<lb/>the sorrow
                        occasioned by the wide-spread report of the<lb/>death of my dear, noble
                        friend and fellow-traveller, Bon-<lb/>pland, I consider it my duty to give
                        at least a brief notice<lb/>of this event, for the particulars of which I am
                        indebted<lb/>to the kind services of Dr. Lallemant, author of an
                        im-<lb/>portant paper on the diseases of Europeans in the tropics.<lb/>This
                        talented gentleman, after leaving the Austrian royal<lb/>expedition in the
                        frigate Novara, in February of this<lb/>year, for the purpose of doing a
                        kindness to myself, made<lb/>the journey from Rio Janeiro to Rio Grande, and
                        thence<lb/>by way of Porto Alegro through the former Jesuit Mis-<lb/>sion to
                        San Borgia, under the erroneous impression that<lb/>Bonpland, who had gone
                        there in 1831, was still resident<lb/>at that place. I have received two
                        letters from Dr. Lal-<lb/>lemant, one dated at San Borgia on the 10th of
                        April,<lb/>the other written from the village of Umguaiana, after he<lb/>had
                        visited Bonpland at Santa Ana. An extended<lb/>abstract of these letters
                        having been sent to the editor of<lb/>the widely-read and interesting
                        botanical journal, <hi rendition="#i">The<lb/>Bonplandia,</hi> in Hanover,
                        the following briefer extracts<lb/>may here suffice.</p>
                    <lb/>
                    <p>&#x201C;In San Borgia,&#x201D; writes Dr. Lallement, &#x201C;I lived
                        with<lb/>an intimate friend of Bonpland, the Vicar Gray, with<lb/>whom I
                        visited the garden of the botanist, so long culti-<lb/>vated with care, but
                        now lying waste and desolate. It<lb/>was near the close of the year 1857
                        that the Vicar last<lb/>received letters from Bonpland, since when
                        intelligence<lb/>had come of his severe illness. Letters of inquiry
                        still<lb/>remained unanswered, and, notwithstanding the short dis-<lb/>tance
                        between the places, the people of San Borgia were<lb/>uncertain whether I
                        should find <choice>
                            <sic>you</sic>
                            <corr type="editorial">your</corr>
                        </choice> fellow-travellers yet<lb/>in the land of the living. In 1853
                        Bonpland had left San<lb/>Borgia and taken up his residence upon his larger
                        plan-<lb/>tation of Santa Ana, where he had long occupied himself<lb/>in the
                        cultivation of orange trees. The residence of the<lb/>aged scholar in the
                        Estancia of Santa Ana consists of<lb/>two large buildings, mere clay walls
                        bound together by<lb/>bamboo sticks, and a few beams, and thatched with
                        straw.<lb/>These buildings have doors, but no windows, the light<lb/>being
                        admitted through the chinks between the bamboo<lb/>sticks. Despite the deep
                        furrows which an eventful life<lb/>had engraven in the beloved countenance,
                        his eye had not<lb/>grown dim nor lost any of its full-thoughted
                        vivacity.<lb/>But lively conversation, though started by
                        himself,<lb/>appeared to weary him much, and he suffered severely<lb/>from a
                        chronic affection of the bladder. The privations<lb/>he had so strangely
                        imposed upon himself are by no means<lb/>in consequence of poverty, or of
                        any necessity for absti-<lb/>nence, but of long custom, great self-control,
                        and charac-<lb/>teristic individuality. The government of Corrientes
                        has<lb/>presented to him an estate valued at 10,000 Spanish<lb/>piasters,
                        and he enjoys a French pension of 3,000 francs<lb/>a year. He has never made
                        the practice of medicine a<lb/>source of pecuniary profit to himself. Though
                        universally<lb/>revered, he loves the solitude, and especially avoids
                        all<lb/>persons who might offer him assistance or advice. His<lb/>scientific
                        ardor has not yet abated, and his collections<lb/>and manuscripts are
                        deposited in Corrientes, where he<lb/>has founded a national museum.</p>
                    <lb/>
                    <p>&#x201C;On the following morning I found him visibly worse,<lb/>and sinking
                        away. The night had been a painful one. I<lb/>pressed him to tell me whether
                        I might not, in some way,<lb/>be of service to him. But I fared no better
                        than his<lb/>other friends&#x2014;he would accept of no assistance.
                        How<lb/>gladly would I have persuaded him to return once more<lb/>to
                        civilized society! But I, too, felt with him that his<lb/>time was past. He
                        belongs to the first half of the nine-<lb/>teenth century, not to the
                        second. I think that your<lb/>friend himself was moved when I took his
                        wasted hands<lb/>in mine with the pressure of farewell. For three
                        months<lb/>now his attendants have remarked his failing strength,<lb/>and
                        perhaps the old man had the same forboding as my-<lb/>self at parting, that
                        I might be the last ambassador of<lb/>European lineage who should penetrate
                        the depths of the<lb/>wilderness to offer him regard, love and thanks, in
                        the<lb/>name of that science which owes so much to his labors.<lb/>I mounted
                        my horse and rode northward through the<lb/>evergreen plains. No path showed
                        my way, no guide<lb/>disturbed me; I was alone with my sorrowful
                        thoughts<lb/>over the departing Bonpland.</p>
                    <lb/>
                    <p>Yet how cheerful the last letter I received from Bon-<lb/>pland, bearing date
                        the 7th of June, 1857! &#x201C;I myself,&#x201D;<lb/>he writes,
                        &#x201C;shall bring all my collections and manu-<lb/>scripts to Paris, and
                        deposit them in the Museum. My<lb/>journey to France will be exceedingly
                        short. I shall re-<lb/>turn to my Santa Ana, where I lead a quiet and
                        happy<lb/>life. Here shall I die, and my sepulchre and my grave<lb/>shall be
                        underneath the shadow of the many trees I have<lb/>planted. Oh, how happy
                        were I, my dear Humboldt,<lb/>could we meet once more, and recall our common
                        expe-<lb/>riences! On the 28th of August next I shall be eighty-<lb
                            break="hyph-yes"/><lb/>four years old, and am yet four years younger
                        than you.<lb/>A man lately died in this vicinity who had attained
                        the<lb/>age of one hundred and seven. What a prospect for two<lb/>travellers
                        who have already stepped beyond the eightieth<lb/>year!&#x201D;</p>
                    <lb/>
                    <p>The cheering, almost life-desiring tone of this letter<lb/>contrasts
                        strangely with the melancholy representations<lb/>of Dr. Lallemant.
                        According to Herr von Tschudi the<lb/>report was credited in Montevideo on
                        the 29th of May,<lb/>that Bonpland had died at Borgia, the date of his
                        death<lb/>uncertain. Yet Dr. Lallemant had spoken with him on<lb/>the 18th
                        of April in Santa Ana, and on May 10 the re-<lb/>port of his death was
                        discredited at Porto Allegro. Thus<lb/>there yet remains ground for hope
                        that the younger is not<lb/>to be first called away. Such remoteness often
                        stretches<lb/>uncertainty to a painful duration; such the
                        solicitude<lb/>felt for Edward Vogel in Central Africa, and for
                        Adol-<lb/>phus Schlagintweit in Central Asia&#x2014;the
                        sorrowfully<lb/>missed!</p>
