The first spring, issuing<lb/>from granite, indicated 90&#x00B7;3° C.; the second, which issues from<lb/>basalt, shewed 96&#x00B7;4° C. The depth of the source of water of these<lb/>temperatures, from what we know of the law of increase of tempera-<lb/>ture in the interior of the earth, must probably be about 6700 feet<lb/>(more than half a geographical mile). If the cause of the heat of<lb/>thermal springs, as well as of active volcanoes, be the universally dif-<lb/>fused heat of the earth, then would rocks produce an effect only<lb/>through their capacity for, and their power of conducting, heat.<lb/>The hottest of all the permanent springs, those, namely, from 95° to<lb/>97° C. (204° to 207&#x00B7;6° F.), it is remarkable, are the purest, are<lb/>those that contain the smallest quantity of mineral matter in solution.<lb/>Their temperature appears, on the whole, to be less permanent than<lb/>that of springs between 50° and 74° C., the invariableness of which,<lb/>both in regard to temperature and mineral impregnation, has been<lb/>maintained so wonderfully, within the confines of Europe at least,<lb/>during the last fifty or sixty years, <hi rendition="#i">i. e.</hi> since accurate thermometrical<lb/>observation and chemical analyses were made. Boussingault found<lb/>that the thermal springs of Las Trincheras had risen in temperature,<lb/>in the course of twenty-three years (from 1800, when my journey was<lb/>performed, to 1823), from 93&#x00B7;3° to 97° C. This very smoothly-<lb break="maybe"/>flowing spring is, consequently, at this time 7° C. higher in tempera-<lb/>ture than the intermitting Geyser and Strokr, the temperature of<lb/>which has been lately more carefully ascertained by Krug of Nidda.<lb/>One of the most remarkable proofs of the origin of these hot springs<lb/><pb n="136" facs="#f0002" />
    being due to the percolation of cold meteoric water into the interior<lb/>of the earth, and its contact there with a volcanic focus, was presented<lb/>in the preceding century, in connexion with the volcano of Jorullo in<lb/>Mexico, which was unknown to geography till after my South Ameri-<lb/>can journey. When this mountain suddenly made its appearance in<lb/>September 1759, rising to a height of 1580 feet above the surround-<lb/>ing level, the two small streams Rios de Cuitimba y de San Pedro dis-<lb/>appeared; but some time afterwards they made their appearance<lb/>again, under the dreadful shocks of an earthquake, as hot springs.<lb/>In 1803, I found their temperature <choice><sic>658</sic><corr type="editorial">65&#x00B7;8</corr></choice>° C.</p><lb/><p>The observations made by Arago in 1821, that the deeper Artesian<lb/>wells are the warmer, was the first means of throwing a great light<lb/>upon the origin of thermal springs, and led to the discovery of the<lb/>law of the increase of the temperature of the earth according to the<lb/>depth. It is remarkable, and only noticed in very recent times, that<lb/>St. Patricius, probably Bishop of Pertusa, was led to a very correct<lb/>view of the phenomenon which presented itself in the appearance of<lb/>hot springs near Carthage, at the end of the third century. When<lb/>questioned as to the cause of the boiling-hot water which poured out<lb/>from the earth, he answered:&#x2014;&#x201C;Fire is nourished in the clouds, and<lb/>in the interior of the earth, as Etna, and another mountain in the<lb/>neighbourhood of Naples, inform you. The subterranean waters rise<lb/>as through syphons; and the cause of the heat of hot springs is this:<lb/>the waters that are remote from the subterraneous fires show them-<lb/>selves colder; those that flow in closer proximity to the fire,<lb/>warmed by it, bring an insupportable heat to the surface which we<lb/>inhabit.&#x201D;&#x2014;<hi rendition="#i">From Baron Humboldt&#x2019;s Cosmos.</hi></p></div><lb/><milestone unit="section" rendition="#hr"/><lb/>
