                    <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName>. Few, indeed, have availed themselves so suc-<lb break="no"/>cessfully of the opportunities they enjoyed; and fewer still<lb break="yes"/>can be found who unite in themselves the private fortune,<lb break="yes"/>the public patronage, the moral demeanour, the strength of<lb break="yes"/>constitution, the intrepidity of spirit, and the accommoda-<lb break="no"/>ting manners, the indefatigable industry, and the general<lb break="yes"/>science which so eminently distinguish this individual. And<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="265" facs="#f0002"/>although the history and dissertations of <persName key="clavigero_fs">Clavigero</persName>, have<lb break="yes"/>disclosed a great body of information concerning Mexico,<lb break="yes"/>as may be seen in our vol. 8, p. 282&#x2014;396, yet a great deal<lb break="yes"/>more is presented in the pages of the work now before us:<lb break="yes"/>particularly of the modern events, and of the more recent<lb break="yes"/>state of things.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>We notice, with much satisfaction, a work treating ex-<lb break="no"/>pressly of that section of <placeName key="nordamerika">North America</placeName> which lies conti-<lb break="no"/>guous to the territory of the United States, and extends<lb break="yes"/>from the southern and western limits thereof, along the<lb break="yes"/>Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean, almost to the foot<lb break="yes"/>of the Peruvian <placeName key="anden" >Andes</placeName>. It may be considered as a sequel<lb break="yes"/>to the description of Caraccas by Mr. Depons, reviewed<lb break="yes"/>in our vol. 10, p. 182: to the Essays on the Natural His-<lb break="no"/>tory of Paraguay, by captain d&#x2019;Azara, noticed in our vol.<lb break="yes"/>9, p. 64: to the History of Chili, by the Abbè <persName key="molina_gi">Molina</persName>,<lb break="yes"/>commented on in our vol. 12, p. 257: to the description of<lb break="yes"/>the Isthmus of Darien, by Mr. Hill, contained in our vol.<lb break="yes"/>8, p. 128: to the Voyage to Statenland, and several places<lb break="yes"/>in the South Sea, by William Moulton, in our vol. 9, p. 51:<lb break="yes"/>to the Voyage to Brazil, by Mr. Lindley, and the descrip-<lb break="no"/>tion of Rio Janeiro, by Mr. Tuckey, in our same vol. p.<lb break="yes"/>195 and 287: to a Voyage to the Caribbee Islands, and the<lb break="yes"/>interior provinces of <placeName key="suedamerika">South America</placeName>, by Dr. Le Blond, in<lb break="yes"/>our vol. 10, p. 65; and to some other tracts and disquisi-<lb break="no"/>tions, occasionally introduced.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The work opens with a learned introduction concerning<lb break="yes"/>the geography of the country. After which, the subsequent<lb break="yes"/>matter is distributed into four books; the first of which<lb break="yes"/>treats of the extent and physical aspect of New Spain, with<lb break="yes"/>the influence of the inequalities of the soil on the climate,<lb break="yes"/>productions, commerce, and military defence. The second<lb break="yes"/>examines the general population, and the different casts or<lb break="yes"/>races of the inhabitants. The third contains a particular<lb break="yes"/>statistical survey of the intendancies, or local governments,<lb break="yes"/>of which this kingdom is composed, with their respective<lb break="yes"/>extent and population. And the fourth is occupied with an<lb break="yes"/>account of the various productions of the soil, and of the<lb break="yes"/>precious metals procured from the bowels of the earth by<lb break="yes"/>mining.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Although some of the details of Baron H. are rather<lb break="yes"/>prolix and tedious, we nevertheless admire the extent and<lb break="yes"/>profundity of his research. And indeed, we could wish<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="266" facs="#f0003"/>that he would give a display equally luminous of every re-<lb break="no"/>gion on the terraqueous globe. We regret that for the rea-<lb break="no"/>sons stated in his note of the 27th June, 1804, and printed<lb break="yes"/>in our vol. 8, p. 96, this estimable traveller should have<lb break="yes"/>been hurried back to Europe, and prevented from viewing<lb break="yes"/>that portion of Fredish-<placeName key="amerika" >America</placeName> which lies to the north-<lb break="no"/>ward and eastward of Philadelphia.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The author has enriched geography and geology with<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">views in profile</hi> of the country situated between the two<lb break="yes"/>oceans which wash the opposite shores of <placeName key="amerika">America</placeName>. These<lb break="yes"/>are additions of great value to the common maps, which<lb break="yes"/>give us but <hi rendition="#i">bird&#x2019;s eye</hi> views. His explanation of the ver-<lb break="no"/>tical section he has delineated of the region between Vera<lb break="yes"/>Cruz and <placeName key="acapulco">Acapulco</placeName>, is so interesting, that we extract it<lb break="yes"/>entire.</p>

                    <p>&#x201C;The horizontal projections known by the name of geo-<lb break="no" />graphical maps, give but a very imperfect idea of the ine-<lb break="no" />qualities of surface and physiognomy of a country. The<lb break="yes" />undulations of the surface (<hi rendition="#i">mouvemens du terrain,</hi>) the form<lb break="yes"/>of the mountains, their relative height, and the rapidity of<lb break="yes"/>the declivities, can only be completely represented in verti-<lb break="no"/>cal sections. A map drawn up on the ingenious plan of<lb break="yes"/>M. Clerc, supplies to a certain degree the place of a reli-<lb break="no"/>evo: and lines drawn on a plane which has but two dimen-<lb break="no"/>sions may produce the same effect as a model in relievo, if<lb break="yes"/>the extent of ground represented is not too great, and if it is<lb break="yes"/>thoroughly known in all its parts. But the difficulties are<lb break="yes"/>almost insurmountable when the horizontal projection em-<lb break="no"/>braces a hilly country of a surface of several thousand<lb break="yes"/>square leagues.</p>
                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>&#x201C;In the most inhabited region of Europe, for example,<lb break="yes" />in France, Germany, or England, the plains which are the<lb break="yes" />seat of cultivation are only elevated, in general, a hundred,<note place="foot" n="*">About 328 feet.&#x2014;<hi rendition="#i">Trans.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <lb break="yes"/>or two hundred metres<note place="foot" n="&#x2020;">About 656 feet.</note> above one another. Their absolute<lb break="yes" />heights are too inconsiderable to have any sensible influence<lb break="yes"/>on the climate. Hence an accurate knowledge of these<lb break="yes"/>elevations is much less interesting to the cultivator than to<lb break="yes"/>
                        <pb n="267" facs="#f0004"/>the naturalist; and hence also, in the maps of Europe, the<lb break="yes"/>geographers merely indicate the most elevated chains of<lb break="yes"/>mountains. But in the equinoxial region of the <placeName key="amerika">new conti-<lb break="no"/>nent</placeName>, particularly in the kingdoms of New Grenada, Quito,<lb break="yes"/>and Mexico, the temperature of the atmosphere, its state of<lb break="yes" />dryness or humidity, the kind of cultivation followed by the<lb break="yes"/>inhabitants, all depend on the enormous elevation of the<lb break="yes"/>planes which stretch along the ridges of the Cordilleras.<lb break="yes"/>The geological constitution of these countries is an object<lb break="yes"/>equally important for the statesman and the naturalist; from<lb break="yes"/>whence it follows that the imperfection of our graphical<lb break="yes"/>methods is much more sensible in a map of New Spain than<lb break="yes"/>in a map of France. Hence, to give a complete idea of<lb break="yes"/>the countries examined by me of which the soil possesses<lb break="yes"/>so extraordinary a configuration, I have been compelled to<lb break="yes"/>recur to methods hitherto unattempted by geographers, be-<lb break="no"/>cause the most simple ideas are usually those which occur<lb break="yes"/>the last.</p>
                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>&#x201C;I have represented whole countries, vast extents of ter-<lb break="no"/>ritory in vertical projections, in the manner in which the<lb break="yes"/>section of a mine or canal is drawn. The principles on<lb break="yes"/>which similar physical views ought to be constructed are<lb break="yes"/>detailed in my Essay on Geological <hi rendition="#i">Pasigraphy.</hi> As the<lb break="yes"/>places of which it is important to know the absolute height<lb break="yes"/>are rarely to be found on the same line, the section is com-<lb break="no"/>posed of several planes, which differ in their direction, or<lb break="yes"/>rather of one plane, which exhibits the average parallel line<lb break="yes"/>of direction on which the perpendiculars fall. In the last<lb break="yes"/>case the distances, exhibited by the physical map differ from<lb break="yes"/>the absolute distances, particularly when the mean direction<lb break="yes"/>of the points whose height and position have been determi-<lb break="no"/>ned deviates considerably from the direction of the plane of<lb break="yes" />projection.</p>
                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>In sections of whole countries, as in sections of canals,<lb break="yes"/>the scale of distances cannot be equal to the scale of eleva-<lb break="no" />tions. If we were to attempt to give the same magnitude<lb break="yes" />these scales, we should be forced either to make the draw-<lb break="no" />ings of an immoderate length, or to adopt a scale of eleva-<lb break="no" />tion so small that the most remarkable inequalities of the<lb break="yes" />soil would become insensible. I have indicated on the plate<lb break="yes" />by two arrows the heights which the Chimborazo and the<lb break="yes" />city of Mexico would have, if the physical view were sub-<lb break="no" />jected to the same standard in all its dimensions. We see<lb break="yes"/>
                        <pb n="268" facs="#f0005"/>that in this case an elevation of 500 metres<note place="foot" n="*">About 1640 feet.&#x2014;<hi rendition="#i">Trans.</hi>
                        </note> would not occu-<lb break="no"/>py in the drawing more than the space of a millimetre.<note place="foot" n="&#x2020;">.03937 of an inch.&#x2014;<hi rendition="#i">ib.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <lb break="yes"/>But in employing for itinerary distances the scale of eleva-<lb break="no"/>tions exhibited in the plates 6, 7, 8, which is nearly 270<lb break="yes"/>metres<note place="foot" n="&#x2021;">About 885<lb break="yes"/>feet.&#x2014;<hi rendition="#i">ib.</hi>

                        </note> a plate would be requisite of<lb break="yes"/>more than 15 metres<note place="foot" n="&#x2551;">About 55 feet.&#x2014;<hi rendition="#i" >ib.</hi>
                        </note> in length, to represent the extent of<lb break="yes"/>country comprised between the meridians of Mexico and<lb break="yes"/>Vera Cruz! Hence from this inequality of scales, my<lb break="yes"/>physical maps, as well as the sections of canals and roads,<lb break="yes"/>drawn up by engineers, do not exhibit the true declinations<lb break="yes"/>of the soil, but these declinations, according to the nature<lb break="yes"/>of the projections employed, appear more rapid in the de-<lb break="no"/>signs than they are in nature. This inconvenience is in-<lb break="no"/>creased if the plains of a great elevation are of very small<lb break="yes"/>extent, or if they are separated by deep and narrow valleys.<lb break="yes"/>It is from the proportion which the scales of distance and<lb break="yes"/>elevation bear to one another that the effect produced by<lb break="yes"/>the section of a country principally depends. I shall not<lb break="yes"/>enter here into a minute discussion of the principles follow-<lb break="no"/>ed by me in this kind of map. Every graphical method<lb break="yes"/>should be subject to rules, and it appeared to me so much<lb break="yes"/>the more necessary to point out some of these rules in this<lb break="yes"/>place, as the imitations of my views recently published are<lb break="yes"/>arbitrary projections on planes abounding with curves, of<lb break="yes"/>which nothing indicates the direction in relation to the<lb break="yes"/>great circles of the sphere.</p>
                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>&#x201C;Physical maps in vertical projections can only be con-<lb break="no" />structed on knowing, for the points through which the plan<lb break="yes" />of projection passes, the three coordinates of longitude, la-<lb break="no"/>titude, and elevation above the level of the ocean; and it is<lb break="yes"/>only in uniting barometrical measurements with the results<lb break="yes"/>of astronomical observations, that the section of a country<lb break="yes"/>can be drawn. This kind of projection will become more<lb break="yes"/>frequent in proportion as travellers shall addict themselves<lb break="yes"/>more assiduously to barometrical observations. But few<lb break="yes"/>provinces of Europe at this day offer the necessary mate-<lb break="no"/>rials for constructing views analagous to those published by<lb break="yes"/>me of equinoxial <placeName key="amerika" >America</placeName>.</p>
                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>&#x201C;The construction of the sections, plates 6, 7 and 8, are<lb break="yes"/>absolutely uniform. The scales are the same in all the three<lb break="yes"/>
                        <pb n="269" facs="#f0006"/>views; the scales of distance are to those of height nearly<lb break="yes"/>as one to twenty-four. The three maps indicate the nature<lb break="yes"/>of the rocks which compose the surface of the soil. This<lb break="yes"/>knowledge is interesting to agriculturalists; and it is also<lb break="yes"/>useful to engineers employed in constructing roads or canals.</p>
                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>&#x201C;I have been blamed for not exhibiting in these sections<lb break="yes"/>the superposition or situation of the secondary or primitive<lb break="yes"/>strata, their inclination or their direction. I had particular<lb break="yes"/>reasons for not indicating these phenomena. I possess in<lb break="yes"/>my itineraries all the necessary geological materials for<lb break="yes"/>forming what are usually called mineralogical maps. A<lb break="yes"/>great number of these materials were published by me in<lb break="yes"/>my recent work on the measurement of the Cordillera of<lb break="yes"/>the <placeName key="anden">Andes</placeName>; but on mature examination I adopted the re-<lb break="no"/>solution of separating entirely the geological sections which<lb break="yes"/>display the superposition of rocks from the physical views<lb break="yes"/>which indicate inequalities of surface. It is very difficult,<lb break="yes"/>I had almost said impossible to construct a geological sec-<lb break="no" />tion of an extensive country, if this section must be subject-<lb break="no"/>ed to a scale of elevation. A stratum of gypsum of one<lb break="yes"/>metre<note place="foot" n="*">39.371 inches. <hi rendition="#i">Trans.</hi>
                        </note> thick is often more interesting to a geologist than<lb break="yes" />an enormous mass of amygdaloid or porphyry; for the ex-<lb break="no" />istence of these very slender strata, and the manner in which<lb break="yes"/>they lie, throw light on the relative antiquity of formations.<lb break="yes"/>How then shall we trace the section of entire provinces, if<lb break="yes"/>the magnitude of the scale is to be such as to exhibit masses<lb break="yes"/>so inconsiderable? How shall we indicate in a narrow val-<lb break="no"/>ley, in that of Papagayo, for example, (plate 7,) in a space<lb break="yes"/>of one<note place="foot" n="&#x2020;">A millimetre contains .03937 of an inch. <hi rendition="#i" >ib.</hi>
                        </note> or two millimetres of breadth, which the valley oc-<lb break="no" />cupies in the drawing, the different formations which repose<lb break="yes"/>on one another? Those who have reflected on graphical<lb break="yes"/>methods, and endeavoured to improve them, will feel, like<lb break="yes"/>myself, that these methods can never unite every advan-<lb break="no"/>tage. A map, for instance, overcharged with signs, be-<lb break="no"/>comes confused, and loses its principal advantage, the power<lb break="yes"/>of conveying at once a great number of relations. The na-<lb break="no"/>ture of the rocks and their mutual superposition interest the<lb break="yes"/>geologist much more than the absolute elevation of forma-<lb break="no"/>tions and thickness of strata. It is sufficient if a geological<lb break="yes"/>section expresses the general aspect of the country, and it<lb break="yes"/>is only in freeing it from scales of height and distance that<lb break="yes"/>
                        <pb n="270" facs="#f0007"/>it can indicate luminously the phenomena of stratification,<lb break="yes"/>which it is of importance for geologists to know.</p>
                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>&#x201C;The physical view of the eastern declivity of New Spain<lb break="yes"/>is composed of three sections, which I have distinguished<lb break="yes"/>by different colours. The cities of Mexico, and la Puebla<lb break="yes"/>de los Angeles, and the small hamlet of Cruz Blanca, situa-<lb break="no"/>ted between Perote and las Vigas, are the points in which<lb break="yes"/>the intersection of the three planes of projection is made.<lb break="yes"/>I have added the longitude and latitude of these points, the<lb break="yes"/>medium direction of each section, and its length in French<lb break="yes"/>leagues of twenty-five to the degree.</p>
                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>&#x201C;The two great volcanoes on the east of the valley of Te-<lb break="no"/>nochtitlan, the Pic d&#x2019;Orizaba, and the Cofre de Perote,<lb break="yes"/>were placed in the drawing according to their true longi-<lb break="no"/>tudes. We have represented them as they appear when a<lb break="yes"/>thick fog covers their base, and when their summits are<lb break="yes"/>seen above the clouds. Notwithstanding the enormous<lb break="yes"/>breadth of these colossal mountains, we have not dared to<lb break="yes"/>represent their whole contours, on account of the great ine-<lb break="no"/>quality of the scales of height and distance. These volca-<lb break="no"/>noes would have disfigured the view, rising like so many<lb break="yes"/>slender columns above the plain. I have endeavoured to<lb break="yes"/>represent very exactly the strange form, I had almost said<lb break="yes"/>the particular physiognomy, of the four great mountains of<lb break="yes"/>the Cordillera of <placeName key="anahuac" >Anahuac</placeName>; and I flatter myself that those<lb break="yes" />who travelled from Vera Cruz to Mexico, and who have<lb break="yes"/>been struck with the wonderful aspect of these majestic<lb break="yes" />mountains, will perceive that the contours are exhibited<lb break="yes" />with precision in this plate, and in No. 9 and 10.</p>
                    <lb break="yes"/>
                    <p>&#x201C;That the reader may fix in his mind some important facts<lb break="yes"/>of physical geography, we have marked on the two sides of<lb break="yes"/>the views, near the scales of elevation, the height of the<lb break="yes"/>Chimborazo, and of several mountains of <placeName key="alpen">the Alps</placeName> and<lb break="yes"/>Pyrenees; that of the limit of perpetual snows under the<lb break="yes"/>
                        <placeName key="aequator">equator</placeName>, under the parallel of Quito, and the 45&#x00B0; of latitude;<lb break="yes"/>the middle temperature of the air at the foot and on the<lb break="yes"/>slope of the Cordilleras; and, lastly, the elevations at which<lb break="yes"/>certain Mexican plants begin to be seen, or cease to vege-<lb break="no"/>tate in the mountainous part of the country. Several of<lb break="yes"/>these phenomena are even repeated in all the maps; a repe-<lb break="no"/>tition analogous to what all the thermometer scales formerly<lb break="yes"/>exhibited, which indicated, though very inaccurately, the<lb break="yes"/>maximum and minimum of temperature observed under<lb break="yes"/>
                        <pb n="271" facs="#f0008"/>such or such a zone. I believed that these sections, which<lb break="yes"/>have some analogy with the large view in my Geography of<lb break="yes"/>plants, might perhaps contribute to propagate the study of<lb break="yes"/>the natural history of the globe.</p>

                            <placeName key="atlantik">Atlantic Ocean</placeName> to the South Sea, and which will develop<lb break="yes"/>to the geologist the extraordinary conformation of the<lb break="yes"/>whole country.</p>
                        <lb break="yes"/>
                        <p>&#x201C;It may be necessary to observe to those who wish to<lb break="yes"/>unite the sections 7 and 8, in cutting the two vertical scales<lb break="yes"/>on which the heights of Puy-de-D&#x00F4;me and Vesuvius are<lb break="yes"/>marked, that the planes of projection of these sections in-<lb break="no"/>tersect each other at right angles, in the centre of the city of<lb break="yes"/>Mexico. The medium direction of the first section, which<lb break="yes"/>is itself composed of different planes, is from east to west;<lb break="yes"/>the medium direction of the second, the road from Mexico<lb break="yes"/>to <placeName key="acapulco">Acapulco</placeName>, is from S.

This plane<lb break="yes"/>prolonged to the west would terminate on the shores of the<lb break="yes"/>South Sea, between Cape Corrientes, and the port de la<lb break="yes"/>Navidad. As New Spain swells out singularly in this<lb break="yes"/>western direction, it would follow that the descent of the<lb break="yes"/>Cordillera, from the valley of Tenochtitlan to the plains of<lb break="yes"/>the intendancy of Guadalaxara, would be twice the length<lb break="yes"/>of the road from Mexico to <placeName key="acapulco">Acapulco</placeName>, sketched in plate 7.<lb break="yes"/>The barometrical measurements which I made between<lb break="yes"/>Valladolid, Pascuaro, <placeName key="ario">Ario</placeName>, and Ocambaro, prove, that in<lb break="yes"/>tracing this transversal section in the direction of the paral-<lb break="no"/>lels of 19 or 20 degrees, the central plain would preserve<lb break="yes"/>the great elevation of 2,000 metres<note place="foot" n="*">6.560 feet. <hi rendition="#i">Trans.</hi>

                        <p>&#x201C;Yet a section directed from east to west, from Vera<lb break="yes"/>Cruz to the small port de la Navidad, is far from giving a<lb break="yes"/>juster idea of the geological constitution of New Spain<lb break="yes"/>than the re-union of my two sections, No. 7 and 8.

                            <placeName key="anahuac">Anahuac</placeName> is sufficient to prove what I advance. The cen-<lb break="no"/>tral chain of the mountains runs from the province of Oax-<lb break="no"/>aca to that of Durango, from the S.

In this mountain-<lb break="no"/>ous region between the 19&#x00B0; and 20&#x00B0; of latitude, nothing an-<lb break="no"/>nounces a longitudinal crest. There are none of those par-<lb break="no"/>allel chains which geologists always admit in their works,<lb break="yes"/>and which geographers represent in the most arbitrary man-<lb break="no" />ner, in their maps of the two continents, like ranges of ele-<lb break="no"/>vated dikes. The Cordillera of <placeName key="anahuac" >Anahuac</placeName> increases towards<lb break="yes"/>the north, from whence the inclined planes formed by the<lb break="yes"/>eastern and western declivities are not parallel to one an-<lb break="no"/>other in their middle direction. This direction is almost<lb break="yes"/>N. and S. along the coast of the gulf of Mexico, while it is<lb break="yes" />S. E. and N.

All these<lb break="yes"/>rivers take their rise at the foot of the Stony Mountains.<lb break="yes"/>But we have not yet sufficient acquaintance with the nature<lb break="yes"/>of the ground through which the communication is proposed<lb break="yes" />to be established, to pronounce upon the utility of these<lb break="yes"/>projects. The journey of Captain Lewis, at the expense of<lb break="yes"/>the Anglo-American government, on the Mississippi and<lb break="yes"/>the Missouri, may throw considerable light on this interest-<lb break="no"/>ing problem.</p>

                            <p>&#x201C;2. Under the 40&#x00B0; of latitude, the sources of the Rio del<lb break="yes"/>Norte, or Rio Bravo, a considerable river which flows into<lb break="yes"/>the gulf of Mexico, are only separated from the sources of<lb break="yes"/>the Rio Colorado by a mountainous tract of from twelve to<lb break="yes"/>thirteen leagues of breadth. This tract is the continuation<lb break="yes"/>
                                <pb n="275" facs="#f0012"/>of the Cordillera of the Cranes, which stretches towards<lb break="yes"/>the Sierra Verde and the lake of Timpanogos, celebrated<lb break="yes"/>in the Mexican history. The Rio S. Rafael and the Rio<lb break="yes"/>S. Xavier are the principal sources of the river Zaguana-<lb break="no"/>nas, which, with the Rio de Nabajoa, forms the Rio Colo-<lb break="no"/>rado: the latter has its <hi rendition="#i">embouchure</hi> in the gulf of Califor-<lb break="no"/>nia. These regions, abounding in rock salt, were exam-<lb break="no"/>ined in 1777 by two travellers full of zeal and intrepidity,<lb break="yes"/>monks of the order of St. <persName key="franzvonassisi">Francis</persName>, Father Escatante and<lb break="yes"/>Father Antonio Velez. But however interesting the Rio<lb break="yes"/>Zaguananas and the Rio del Norte may one day become<lb break="yes"/>for the internal commerce of this northern part of New<lb break="yes"/>Spain, and however easy the carriage may be across the<lb break="yes"/>mountains no communication will ever result from it com-<lb break="no"/>parable to that opened directly from sea to sea.</p>

                            <p>&#x201C;3. The isthmus of Tehuantepec comprises, under the<lb break="yes"/>16&#x00B0; of latitude, the sources of the Rio Huasacualco, which<lb break="yes"/>is discharged into the gulf of Mexico, and the sources of<lb break="yes"/>the Rio de Chimalapa. The waters of this last river mix<lb break="yes"/>with those of the Pacific Ocean near the Barra de S. Fran-<lb break="no"/>cisco. I consider here the Rio del Passo as the principal<lb break="yes" />source of the river Huasacualco, although the latter only<lb break="yes"/>takes its name at the Passo de la Fabrica, after one of its<lb break="yes"/>arms, which comes from the mountains de los Mexes,<lb break="yes"/>unites with the Rio del Passo. We shall examine after-<lb break="no"/>wards the possibility of cutting a canal of from six to se-<lb break="no"/>ven leagues in the forests of Tarifa. We shall merely ob-<lb break="no"/>serve here, that since 1798, a road has been opened<lb break="yes"/>which leads by land from the port of Tehuantepec, to the<lb break="yes"/>Embarcadero de la Cruz, (a road completed in 1800,) the<lb break="yes"/>Rio Huasacualco forms, in reality, a commercial commu-<lb break="no" />nication between the oceans. During the course of the<lb break="yes"/>war with the English, the indigo of Guatimala, the most<lb break="yes"/>precious of all known indigoes, came by the way of this<lb break="yes"/>isthmus to the port of Vera Cruz, and from thence to Eu-<lb break="no"/>rope.</p>

                            <p>&#x201C;4. The great lake of Nicaragua communicates not only<lb break="yes"/>with the lake of Leon, but also on the east, by the river of<lb break="yes"/>San Juan, with the <placeName key="antillischesmeer">Sea of the Antilles</placeName>. The communica-<lb break="no"/>tion with the Pacific Ocean would be effected in cutting a<lb break="yes"/>canal across the isthmus which separates the lake from the<lb break="yes"/>gulf of Papagayo. On this strait isthmus are to be found<lb break="yes"/>the volcanic and isolated summits of Bombacho, (at 11&#x00B0;<lb break="yes"/>7&#x2032; of latitude,) of Grenada, and of the Papagayo, (at 10&#x00B0;<lb break="yes"/>
                                <pb n="276" facs="#f0013"/>50&#x2032; of latitude.) The old maps point out a communica-<lb break="no"/>tion by water as existing across the isthmus from the lake<lb break="yes"/>to the Great Ocean. Other maps, somewhat newer, repre-<lb break="no"/>sent a river under the name of Rio Partido, which gives<lb break="yes"/>one of its branches to the Pacific Ocean, and the other to<lb break="yes"/>the lake of Nicaragua; but this divided stream does not<lb break="yes" />appear on the last maps published by the Spaniards and<lb break="yes"/>English.</p>

                            <p>&#x201C;There are in the archives of Madrid several French and<lb break="yes"/>English memoirs, on the possibility of the junction of the<lb break="yes"/>lake of Nicaragua with the Pacific Ocean. The com-<lb break="no"/>merce carried on by the English on the coast of Mosquitos<lb break="yes"/>has greatly contributed to give celebrity to this project of<lb break="yes"/>communication between the two seas. In none of the me-<lb break="no"/>moirs which have come to my knowledge is the principal<lb break="yes"/>point, the height of the ground in the isthmus, sufficiently<lb break="yes" />cleared up.</p>
                            <lb break="yes"/>
                            <p>&#x201C;From the kingdom of New Grenada to the environs of<lb break="yes"/>the capital of Mexico, there is not a single mountain, a sin-<lb break="no"/>gle level, a single city, of which we know the elevation<lb break="yes"/>above the level of the sea. Does there exist an <hi rendition="#i">uninter-<lb break="no" />rupted</hi> chain of mountains in the provinces of Veragua<lb break="yes"/>and Nicaragua? Has this Cordillera, which is supposed to<lb break="yes"/>unite the <placeName key="anden" >Andes</placeName> of Peru to the mountains of Mexico, its<lb break="yes"/>central chain to the west or the east of the lake of Nica-<lb break="no"/>ragua? Would not the isthmus of Papagayo rather present<lb break="yes"/>a hilly tract than a continued cordillera? These are pro-<lb break="no"/>blems whose solution is equally interesting to the states-<lb break="no"/>man and the geographical naturalist?</p>
                            <lb break="yes"/>
                            <p>&#x201C;There is no spot on the globe so full of volcanoes as this<lb break="yes"/>part of <placeName key="amerika" >America</placeName>, from the 11&#x00B0; or 13&#x00B0; of latitude; but do<lb break="yes"/>not these conical summits form groups which, separately<lb break="yes"/>from one another, rise from the plan itself? We ought not<lb break="yes"/>to be astonished that we are ignorant of these very import-<lb break="no"/>ant facts; we shall soon see that even the height of the<lb break="yes"/>mountains which traverse the isthmus of Panama is not yet<lb break="yes"/>known. Perhaps the communication of the lake of Nica-<lb break="no"/>ragua with the Pacific Ocean would be carried on by the<lb break="yes" />lake of Leon, by means of the river Tosta, which, on the<lb break="yes"/>road from Leon to Realexo, descends from the volcano of<lb break="yes"/>Telica. In fact, the ground appears there very little ele-<lb break="no"/>vated. The account of the voyage of <persName key="dampier_01">Dampier</persName> leads us<lb break="yes"/>even to suppose that there exists no <hi rendition="#i">chain of mountains</hi>
                                <lb break="yes"/>between the lake of Nicaragua and the South Sea. &#x201C;The<lb break="yes"/>
                                <pb n="277" facs="#f0014"/>coast of Nicoya,&#x201D; says this great navigator, &#x201C;is low, and<lb break="yes"/>covered at full tide. To arrive from Realexo to Leon, we<lb break="yes"/>must go twenty miles across a country flat and covered<lb break="yes"/>with mangle trees.&#x201D; The city of Leon itself is situated in<lb break="yes" />a savanna. There is a small river which, passing near<lb break="yes"/>Realexo, might facilitate the communication between the<lb break="yes"/>latter port and that of Leon. From the west bank of the<lb break="yes"/>lake of Nicaragua there are only four marine leagues to<lb break="yes"/>the bottom of the gulf of Papagayo, and seven to that of<lb break="yes"/>Nicoya, which navigators call la Caldera. <persName key="dampier_01" >Dampier</persName> says<lb break="yes"/>expressly that the ground between la Caldera and the lake<lb break="yes"/>is a little hilly, but for the greatest part level and like a sa-<lb break="no" />vanna.</p>
                            <lb break="yes"/>
                            <p>&#x201C;The coast of Nicaragua is almost inaccessible in the<lb break="yes"/>months of August, September and October, on account of<lb break="yes"/>the terrible storms and rains; in January and February,<lb break="yes"/>on account of the furious north-east and east-north-east<lb break="yes"/>winds, called Papagayos. This circumstance is exceed-<lb break="no"/>ingly inconvenient for navigation. The port of Tehuan-<lb break="no"/>tepec, on the isthmus of Guasacualco, is not more favoured<lb break="yes"/>by nature; it gives its name to the hurricanes which blow<lb break="yes"/>from the northwest, and which frighten vessels from land-<lb break="no"/>ing at the small ports of Sabinas and Ventosa.</p>

                            <p>5. The isthmus of Panama was crossed for the first time<lb break="yes"/>by Vasco Nunez de Bilboa, in 1513. Since this memo-<lb break="no"/>rable epocha in the history of geographical discoveries, the<lb break="yes"/>project of a canal has occupied every mind; and yet at<lb break="yes"/>this day, after the lapse of 300 years, there neither exists a<lb break="yes"/>survey of the ground, nor an exact determination of the<lb break="yes"/>positions of Panama and Porto-bello. The longitude of<lb break="yes"/>the first of these two ports has been found with relation to<lb break="yes"/>Carthagena; the longitude of the second has been fixed<lb break="yes"/>from Guayaquil. The operations of <persName key="fidalgo_jfd">Fidalgo</persName> and <persName key="malaspina_a">Malas-<lb break="no"/>pina</persName> are undoubtedly deserving of very great confidence;<lb break="yes"/>but errors are insensibly multiplied, when by chronome-<lb break="no" />trical operations from the isle of Trinidad to Porto-bello,<lb break="yes"/>and from Lima to Panama, one position becomes depen-<lb break="no"/>dent on another. It would be important to carry the<lb break="yes"/>time directly from Panama to Porto-bello, and thus to con-<lb break="no"/>nect the operations in the South Sea with those which the<lb break="yes"/>Spanish government has carried on in the <placeName key="atlantik">Atlantic Ocean</placeName>.<lb break="yes"/>Perhaps MM. <persName key="fidalgo_jfd" >Fidalgo</persName>, Tiscar, and Noguera, may one<lb break="yes" />day, advance with their instruments to the southern coast<lb break="yes"/>of the isthmus, while MM. Colmenares, Isasviravill, and<lb break="yes"/>
                                <pb n="278" facs="#f0015"/>Quartara, shall carry their operations to the northern coast.<lb break="yes"/>To form an idea of the uncertainty which still prevails as<lb break="yes"/>to the form and breadth of the isthmus, (for example to-<lb break="no"/>wards Nata,) we have only to compare the maps of Lopez<lb break="yes"/>with those of Arrowsmith, and with the more recent ones<lb break="yes"/>of the <hi rendition="#i">Deposito Hydrografico</hi> of Madrid. The river<lb break="yes"/>Chagre, which flows into the <placeName key="antillischesmeer">sea of the Antilles</placeName> to the west<lb break="yes"/>of Porto-bello, presents, notwithstanding its sinuosities and<lb break="yes"/>its rapids, great facility for commerce; its breadth is 120<lb break="yes"/>toises at its mouth, and 20 toises near Cruces, where it be-<lb break="no"/>gins to be navigable. It requires four or five days at pre-<lb break="no"/>sent to ascend the Rio Chagre from its mouth to Cruces.<lb break="yes" />If the waters are very high, the current must be struggled<lb break="yes"/>with for ten or twelve days. From Cruces to Panama<lb break="yes"/>merchandise is transported on the backs of mules for a<lb break="yes"/>space of five small leagues. The barometrical heights re-<lb break="no"/>lated in the travels of <persName key="ulloa_ad">Ulloa</persName> lead me to suppose that there<lb break="yes"/>exists in the Rio Chagre, from the <placeName key="antillischesmeer">sea of the Antilles</placeName> to<lb break="yes"/>the Embarcadero, or Venta de Cruces, a difference of le-<lb break="no"/>vel of from 35 to 40 toises. This must appear a very<lb break="yes"/>small difference to those who have ascended the Rio Cha-<lb break="no" />gre; they forget that the force of the current depends as<lb break="yes"/>much on a great accumulation of water near the sources,<lb break="yes"/>as on the general descent of the river; that is to say, of<lb break="yes"/>the descent of the Rio Chagre above Cruces. On compa-<lb break="no"/>ring the barometrical survey of <persName key="ulloa">Ulloa</persName> with that made by<lb break="yes"/>myself in the river of Magdalen, we perceive that the ele-<lb break="no"/>vation of Cruces above the ocean, far from being small, is,<lb break="yes"/>on the contrary, very considerable. The fall of the Rio de<lb break="yes"/>la Madelena from Honda to the dyke of Mahates, near<lb break="yes"/>Barrancas, is nearly 170 toises;<note place="foot" n="*">1088 feet. <hi rendition="#i" >Trans.</hi>
                                </note> and this distance never-<lb break="no"/>theless is not as we might suppose four times, but eight<lb break="yes"/>times, greater, than that of Cruces at the fort of Chagre.</p>
                            <lb break="yes"/>
                            <p>&#x201C;The engineers in proposing to the court of Madrid that<lb break="yes"/>the river Chagre should serve for establishing a communi-<lb break="no"/>cation between the two oceans, have projected a canal from<lb break="yes"/>the Venta de Cruces to Panama. This canal would have<lb break="yes"/>to pass through a hilly tract of the height of which we are<lb break="yes"/>completely ignorant. We only know that, from Cruces,<lb break="yes"/>the ascent is at first rapid, and that there is then a descent<lb break="yes" />for several hours towards the South Sea. It is very asto-<lb break="no"/>nishing that, in crossing the isthmus, neither La Conda-<lb break="no"/>
                                <pb n="279" facs="#f0016"/>mine nor Don <persName key="juanysantacilia_j">George Juan</persName> and <persName key="ulloa_ad">Ulloa</persName> had the curiosity to<lb break="yes"/>observe their barometer, for the sake of informing us what<lb break="yes"/>is the height of the most elevated point on the route to the<lb break="yes"/>castle of Chagre at Panama. These illustrious <hi rendition="#i">savans</hi> so-<lb break="no" />journed three months in that interesting region for the<lb break="yes"/>commercial world; but their stay has added little to the<lb break="yes"/>old observations which we owe to <persName key="dampier_01">Dampier</persName> and to Wafer.<lb break="yes" />However, it appears beyond a doubt that we find the prin-<lb break="no"/>cipal Cordillera, or rather a range of hills that may be re-<lb break="no"/>garded as a prolongation of the <placeName key="anden">Andes</placeName> of New Grenada,<lb break="yes" />towards the South Sea, between Cruces and Panama. It<lb break="yes"/>is from thence that the two oceans are said to be discerni-<lb break="no"/>ble at the same time, which would only require an absolute<lb break="yes"/>height of 290 metres.<note place="foot" n="&#x2020;">947 Engli&#x017F;h feet. <hi rendition="#i">Trans.</hi>
                                </note> However, Lionel Wafer com-<lb break="no"/>plains that he could not enjoy this interesting spectacle.<lb break="yes"/>He assures us, moreover, that the hills which form the<lb break="yes" />central chain are separated from one another by valleys<lb break="yes"/>which allow <hi rendition="#i">free course</hi> for passage of the rivers. If this<lb break="yes"/>last assertion be founded, we might believe in the possibi-<lb break="no"/>lity of a canal from Cruces to Panama, of which the navi-<lb break="no" />gation would only be interrupted by a very few locks.</p>
                            <lb break="yes"/>
                            <p>&#x201C;There are other points where, according to memoirs<lb break="yes"/>drawn up in 1528, the isthmus has been proposed to be<lb break="yes"/>cut, for example in joining the sources of the rivers called<lb break="yes"/>Caimito and Rio Grande, with the Rio Trinidad. The<lb break="yes"/>eastern part of the isthmus is the narrowest, but the ground<lb break="yes"/>appears to be also most elevated there. This is at least<lb break="yes"/>what has been remarked in the frightful road travelled by<lb break="yes"/>the courier from Porto-bello to Panama, a two days jour-<lb break="no" />ney, which goes by the village of Pequeni, and is full of<lb break="yes"/>the greatest difficulties.</p>
                            <lb break="yes"/>
                            <p>&#x201C;In every age and climate, of two neighbouring seas, the<lb break="yes"/>one has been considered as more elevated than the other.<lb break="yes"/>Traces of this vulgar opinion are to be found among the<lb break="yes"/>ancients. <persName key="strabo" >Strabo</persName> relates, that in his time the gulf of Co-<lb break="no"/>rinth near Lechaeum was believed to be above the level of<lb break="yes"/>the sea of Cenchreae. He is of opinion that it would be<lb break="yes"/>very dangerous to cut the isthmus of the Peloponesus in<lb break="yes"/>the place where the Corinthians, by means of particular<lb break="yes"/>machines, had established a <hi rendition="#i">portage.</hi> In <placeName key="amerika" >America</placeName>, the<lb break="yes"/>South Sea is generally supposed to be higher at the isth-<lb break="no"/>mus of Panama than the <placeName key="atlantik">Atlantic Ocean</placeName>. After a strug-<lb break="no"/>
                                <pb n="280" facs="#f0017"/>gle of several days against the current of the Rio Chagre,<lb break="yes"/>we naturally believe the ascent to be greater than the des-<lb break="no"/>cent from the hills near Cruces to Panama. Nothing in<lb break="yes"/>fact, can be more treacherous than the estimates which we<lb break="yes"/>are apt to form of the difference of level on a long and easy<lb break="yes" />descent. I could hardly believe my own eyes at Peru,<lb break="yes"/>when I found by means of a barometrical measurement,<lb break="yes"/>that the city of Lima was 91 toises<note place="foot" n="*">582 feet.&#x2014;<hi rendition="#i">Trans.</hi>
                                </note> higher than the port<lb break="yes"/>of Callao. An earthquake must cover entirely the rock<lb break="yes"/>of the isle San Lorenzo with water before the ocean can<lb break="yes"/>reach the capital of Peru. The idea of a difference of<lb break="yes" />level between the <placeName key="atlantik">Atlantic</placeName> and South Sea has been combated<lb break="yes"/>by Don <persName key="juanysantacilia_j">George Juan</persName>, who found the height of the column<lb break="yes"/>of mercury the same at the mouth of the Chagre and at<lb break="yes"/>Panama.</p>
                            <lb break="yes"/>
                            <p>&#x201C;The imperfection of the meteorological instruments then<lb break="yes"/>in use, and the want of every sort of thermometrical correc-<lb break="no"/>tion of the calculation of heights might also give rise to<lb break="yes"/>doubts.

                            <p>&#x201C;The navigation of the river Chagre is difficult, both on<lb break="yes"/>account of its sinuosities and the celerity of the current,<lb break="yes"/>frequently from one to two metres per second.<note place="foot" n="*">From 3.28 to 6.56 feet. <hi rendition="#i">Trans.</hi>

The elevation of the ground would force<lb break="yes"/>the engineer to have recourse either to subterraneous gal-<lb break="no"/>leries, or to the system of sluices; and the merchandise<lb break="yes"/>destined to pass the isthmus of Panama could only there-<lb break="no"/>fore be transported in flat-bottomed boats unable to keep<lb break="yes" />the sea. Entrepots at Panama and Portobello would be<lb break="yes"/>requisite. Every nation which wished to trade in this<lb break="yes"/>way would be dependent on the masters of the isthmus and<lb break="yes"/>canal; and this would be a very great inconvenience for<lb break="yes"/>the vessels despatched from Europe. Supposing then that<lb break="yes"/>this canal were cut, the greatest number of these vessels<lb break="yes"/>would probably continue their voyage round Cape Horn.<lb break="yes"/>We see that the passage of the Sound is still frequented,<lb break="yes" />notwithstanding the existence of the Eyder canal, which<lb break="yes"/>connects the ocean with the <placeName key="ostsee" >Baltic sea</placeName>.</p>

                            <p>&#x201C;It would be otherwise with the productions of western<lb break="yes"/>
                                <placeName key="amerika">America</placeName>, or the goods sent from Europe to the coast of<lb break="yes"/>the Pacific Ocean. These goods would cross the isthmus<lb break="yes"/>at less expense, and with less danger, particularly in time<lb break="yes"/>of war, than in doubling the southern extremity of the <placeName key="amerika" >new<lb break="yes"/>continent</placeName>. In the present state of things the carriage of<lb break="yes"/>three quintals on mule-back from Panama to Porto-bello<lb break="yes"/>costs from three to four piasters, (from 12<hi rendition="#i">s.</hi> 6<hi rendition="#i">d.</hi> to 16<hi rendition="#i">s.</hi> 8<hi rendition="#i">d.</hi>)<lb break="yes"/>But the uncultivated state in which the government allows<lb break="yes"/>the isthmus to remain is such, that the carriage of the cop-<lb break="no"/>per of Chili, the quinquina of Peru, and the 60 or 70,000<lb break="yes" />vanegas of cacao annually exported by Guayaquil, across<lb break="yes"/>this neck of land, requires many more beasts of burthen<lb break="yes"/>than can be procured, so that the slow and expensive navi-<lb break="no"/>gation round Cape Horn is preferred.</p>

                            <p>&#x201C;In 1802 and 1803, when the Spanish commerce was<lb break="yes"/>every where harassed by the English cruizers, a great part<lb break="yes"/>of the cacao was carried across the kingdom of New Spain,<lb break="yes"/>and embarked at Vera Cruz for Cadiz. They preferred<lb break="yes"/>the passage from Guayaquil to <placeName key="acapulco">Acapulco</placeName>, and a land<lb break="yes"/>
                                <pb n="283" facs="#f0020"/>journey of a hundred leagues from <placeName key="acapulco">Acapulco</placeName> to Vera Cruz,<lb break="yes"/>to the danger of a long navigation by Cape Horn, and the<lb break="yes"/>difficulty of struggling with the current along the coasts of<lb break="yes"/>Peru and Chili. This example proves, that, if the <choice><sic>construc-<lb break="no"/>of</sic><corr type="editorial">construc-<lb break="no"/>tion of</corr></choice> a canal across the isthmus of Panama, or that of Guasa-<lb break="no"/>cualco, abounds with too many difficulties from the multi-<lb break="no"/>plicity of sluices, the commerce of <placeName key="amerika" >America</placeName> would gain<lb break="yes"/>the most important advantages from good causeways carried<lb break="yes" />from Tehuantepec to the Embarcadero de la Cruz, and<lb break="yes" />from Panama to Porto-bello. It is true that in the isthmus,<lb break="yes"/>the pasturage to this day is very unfavourable to the nour-<lb break="no"/>ishment and multiplication of cattle; but it would be easy<lb break="yes"/>in so fertile a soil to form savannas, by cutting down forests,<lb break="yes"/>or to cultivate the <hi rendition="#i">paspalum purpureum</hi>, the <hi rendition="#i">milium nigri-<lb break="no"/>cans</hi> and particularly the <hi rendition="#i">medicago sativa</hi>, which grows<lb break="yes"/>abundantly in Peru in the warmest districts. The intro-<lb break="no"/>duction of camels would be still a surer means of diminish-<lb break="no"/>ing the expense of carriage. These land ships, as they are<lb break="yes"/>called by the orientals, hitherto exist only in the province<lb break="yes" />of Caraccas, and were brought there from the Canary isl-<lb break="no"/>ands by the <persName key="marquisdetoro_01">Marquis de Toro</persName>.</p>

                            <p>&#x201C;Moreover, no political consideration should oppose the<lb break="yes"/>progress of population, agriculture, commerce and civiliza-<lb break="no"/>tion, in the isthmus of Panama. The more this neck of<lb break="yes"/>land shall be cultivated, the more resistance will it oppose<lb break="yes"/>to the enemies of the Spanish government. The events<lb break="yes"/>which took place at Buenos Ayres prove the advantages of<lb break="yes"/>a concentrated population in the case of an invasion. If<lb break="yes"/>any enterprising nation wished to become possessed of the<lb break="yes" />isthmus, it could do so with the greatest ease at present,<lb break="yes"/>when good and numerous fortifications are destitute of arms<lb break="yes"/>to defend them. The unhealthiness of the climate, though<lb break="yes"/>now much diminished at Porto-bello, would alone oppose<lb break="yes"/>great obstacles to any military undertaking in the isthmus.<lb break="yes"/>It is from St. Charles de Chiloe, and not from Panama,<lb break="yes"/>that Peru can be attacked. It requires from three to five<lb break="yes"/>months to ascend from Panama to Lima. But the whale<lb break="yes"/>and cachalot fishery, which in 1803 drew 60 English vessels<lb break="yes"/>to the South Sea, and the facilities for the Chinese com-<lb break="no"/>merce and the furs of Nootka Sound, are baits of a very<lb break="yes"/>seductive nature. They will draw, sooner or later, the<lb break="yes"/>masters of the ocean to a point of the globe destined by na-<lb break="no"/>
                                <pb n="284" facs="#f0021"/>ture to change the face of the commercial system of na-<lb break="no"/>tions.</p>

                            <p>&#x201C;6. To the south-east of Panama, following the coast of<lb break="yes"/>the Pacific Ocean, from Cape S. Miguel to Cape Corientes,<lb break="yes"/>we find the small port and bay of Cupica. The name of<lb break="yes"/>this bay has acquired celebrity in the kingdom of New<lb break="yes"/>Grenada, on account of a new plan of communication be-<lb break="no"/>tween the two seas. From Cupica, we cross, for five or<lb break="yes"/>six marine leagues, a soil quite level and proper for a canal,<lb break="yes"/>which would terminate at the Embarcadero of the Rio<lb break="yes"/>Naipi. This last river is navigable, and flows below the<lb break="yes"/>village of Zitara into the great <placeName key="atrato">Rio Atrato</placeName>, which itself<lb break="yes"/>enters the <placeName key="atlantik">Atlantic Sea</placeName>. A very intelligent Biscayan pilot,<lb break="yes"/>M. <persName key="gogueneche_01">Gogueneche</persName>, was the first who had the merit of turning<lb break="yes"/>the attention of government to the bay of Cupica, which<lb break="yes"/>ought to be for the <placeName key="amerika">new continent</placeName> what Suez was formerly<lb break="yes"/>for <placeName key="asien" >Asia</placeName>. M. <persName key="gogueneche_01" >Gogueneche</persName> proposed to transport the cacao<lb break="yes"/>of Guayaquil, by the Rio Naipi to Carthagena. The same<lb break="yes"/>way offers the advantage of a very quick communication<lb break="yes"/>between Cadiz and Lima. Instead of despatching couriers<lb break="yes"/>by Carthagena, Santa Fe, and Quito, or by Buenos Ayres<lb break="yes"/>and Mendoza, good quick sailing packet-boats should be<lb break="yes"/>sent from Cupica to Peru. If this plan were carried into<lb break="yes"/>execution, the viceroy of Lima would have no longer to<lb break="yes"/>wait five or six months for the orders of his court. Besides<lb break="yes"/>the environs of the Bay of Cupica abounds with excellent<lb break="yes" />timber fit to be carried to Lima. We might almost say<lb break="yes"/>that the ground between Cupica and the mouth of the <placeName key="atrato">Atrato</placeName>
                                <lb break="yes"/>is the only part of all <placeName key="amerika" >America</placeName> in which the chain of the<lb break="yes"/>

                            <p>&#x201C;7. In the interior of the province of Choco, the small<lb break="yes"/>ravine (Quebrada) de la Raspadura, unites the neighbour-<lb break="no"/>ing sources of the Rio de Noanama, called also Rio San<lb break="yes"/>Juan, and the small river Quito. The latter, the Rio An-<lb break="no"/>dageda and the Rio Zitara, form the <placeName key="atrato">Rio d&#x2019;Atrato</placeName> which<lb break="yes"/>discharges itself into the <placeName key="atlantik">Atlantic Ocean</placeName>, while the Rio San<lb break="yes"/>Juan flows into the South Sea. A monk of great activity,<lb break="yes"/>
                                <hi rendition="#i">curé</hi> of the village of Novita, employed his parishioners to<lb break="yes"/>dig a small canal in the ravine de la Raspadura, by means<lb break="yes"/>of which, when the rains are abundant, canoes loaded with<lb break="yes"/>cacao pass from sea to sea. This interior communication<lb break="yes"/>has existed since 1788, unknown in Europe. The small<lb break="yes"/>
                                <pb n="285" facs="#f0022"/>canal of Raspadura unites, on the coasts of the two oceans,<lb break="yes"/>two points 75 leagues distant from one another.</p>

                            <p>&#x201C;8. In the 10&#x00B0; of south latitude, two or three days jour-<lb break="no"/>ney from Lima, we reach the banks of the Rio Guallaga,<lb break="yes"/>(or Huallaga,) by which we may, without doubling Cape<lb break="yes"/>Horn, arrive at the banks of the grand Para in Brazil.<lb break="yes"/>The sources even of the Rio Huanuco, which runs into<lb break="yes"/>the Guallaga, are only four or five leagues distant from the<lb break="yes"/>source of the Rio Huaura, which flows into the Pacific<lb break="yes"/>Ocean. The Rio Xauxo, also, which contributes to form<lb break="yes"/>the Apuremac and the Ucayale, has its rise near the source<lb break="yes"/>of the Rio Rimac. The height of the Cordillera, and the<lb break="yes"/>nature of the ground, render the execution of a canal im-<lb break="no"/>possible; but the construction of a commodious road, from<lb break="yes"/>the capital of Peru to the Rio de Huanaco, would facili-<lb break="no"/>tate the transport of goods to Europe. The great rivers<lb break="yes"/>Ucayale and Guallaga would carry in five or six weeks the<lb break="yes"/>productions of Peru to the mouth of the <placeName key="amazonas" >Amazons</placeName>, and<lb break="yes"/>to the neighbouring coasts of Europe, while a passage of<lb break="yes"/>four months is requisite to convey the same goods to the<lb break="yes"/>same point, in doubling Cape Horn. The cultivation of<lb break="yes"/>the fine regions situated on the eastern declivity of the An-<lb break="no"/>des, and the prosperity and wealth of their inhabitants, de-<lb break="no"/>pend on the free navigation of the <placeName key="amazonas">river of the Amazons</placeName>.<lb break="yes"/>This liberty, denied by the court of Portugal to the Spani-<lb break="no"/>ards, might have been acquired in the sequel to the events<lb break="yes"/>which preceded the peace of 1801.</p>

                            <p>&#x201C;9. Before the coast of the Patagonians was sufficiently<lb break="yes"/>known, the Gulf of St. George, situated between the 45&#x00B0;<lb break="yes"/>and the 47&#x00B0; of south latitude, was supposed to enter so far<lb break="yes"/>into the interior of the country, as to communicate with the<lb break="yes"/>arms of the sea which interrupt the continuity of the west-<lb break="no"/>ern coast, that is to say, with the coast opposite to the archi-<lb break="no" />pelago of Chayamapu. Were this supposition founded on<lb break="yes"/>solid basis, the vessels destined for the South Sea might<lb break="yes"/>cross <placeName key="suedamerika">South America</placeName> 7&#x00B0; to the north of the Straits of Ma-<lb break="no"/>gellan, and shorten their route more than 700 leagues. In<lb break="yes"/>this way, navigators might avoid the dangers which, not-<lb break="no"/>withstanding the perfection of nautical science, still accom-<lb break="no"/>pany the voyage round Cape Horn and along the Patagonian<lb break="yes"/>coast, from Cape Pilares to the parallel of the Chonos isl-<lb break="no"/>ands, These ideas, in 1790, occupied the attention of the<lb break="yes" />court of Madrid. M. Gil Lemos, viceroy of Peru, an up-<lb break="no"/>
                                <pb n="286" facs="#f0023"/>right and zealous administrator, equipped a small expedi-<lb break="no"/>tion under the orders M. Moraleda, to examine the south-<lb break="no"/>ern coast of Chili. I saw the instructions that he received<lb break="yes"/>at Lima, which recommended to him the greatest secrecy<lb break="yes"/>in case he should be happy enough to discover a communi-<lb break="no"/>cation between the two seas. But M. Moraleda discover-<lb break="no"/>ed in 1794, that the Estero de Aysen, visited before him in<lb break="yes" />1763 by the jesuits, fathers <persName key="garcia_j">Jose Garcia</persName> and Juan Vicuna,<lb break="yes"/>was of all the arms of the sea that in which the waters of the<lb break="yes" />ocean advance the farthest towards the east. Yet it is but<lb break="yes"/>eight leagues in length, and terminates at the isle de la<lb break="yes"/>Cruz, where it receives a small river, near a hot spring.<lb break="yes"/>Hence the canal of Aysen, situated in the 45&#x00B0; 28&#x2032; of lati-<lb break="no"/>tude, is still 88 leagues distant from the Gulf of St. George.<lb break="yes"/>This gulf was exactly surveyed by the expedition of <persName key="malaspina_a" >Malas-<lb break="no"/>pina</persName>. In the year 1746 a communication was, in the same<lb break="yes"/>manner, suspected in Europe between the bay of St. Julien<lb break="yes"/>(latitude 50&#x00B0; 53&#x2032;) and the Great Ocean.</p>

These sketches are not of equal accuracy, as-<lb break="no"/>tronomically considered; but I wished to save the reader<lb break="yes"/>the labour of seeking in several maps what may be con-<lb break="no" />tained in one; and it is the duty of the government which<lb break="yes"/>possesses the finest and most fertile part of the globe to<lb break="yes"/>perfect what I have merely hinted at in this discussion.<lb break="yes"/>Two Spanish engineers, MM.

                                <lb break="yes"/>to the South Sea. The time is past &#x201C;when Spain, through<lb break="yes"/>a jealous policy, refused to other nations a thoroughfare<lb break="yes"/>

The taste for astronomy is very old in Mexico.<lb break="yes"/>Three distinguished men, <persName key="velazquezcardenasyleon_j">Velasquez</persName>, <persName key="leonygama_ad">Gama</persName>, and Alzate,<lb break="yes"/>did honour to their country towards the end of the last cen-<lb break="no"/>tury. All the three made a great number of astronomical<lb break="yes"/>observations, especially of eclipses of the satellites of Ju-<lb break="no"/>piter. Alzate, the worst informed of them, was the corre-<lb break="no"/>spondent of the Academy of Sciences at Paris. Inaccurate<lb break="yes"/>as an observer, and of an activity frequently impetuous, he<lb break="yes"/>
                                <pb n="355" facs="#f0032"/>gave himself up to too many objects at a time. We have<lb break="yes"/>already discussed in the geographical introduction the me-<lb break="no"/>rits of his astronomical labours. He is entitled to the real<lb break="yes"/>merit, however, of having excited his countrymen to the<lb break="yes"/>study of the physical sciences. The <hi rendition="#i">Gazetta de Litteratu-<lb break="no"/>ra,</hi> which he published for a long time at Mexico, contri-<lb break="no"/>buted singularly to give encouragement and impulsion to<lb break="yes"/>the Mexican youth.&#x201D;</p>

                            <p>That Intendancy of New Spain which lies contiguous to<lb break="yes" />the territory of the United States, is that of Saint Louis<lb break="yes"/>Potosi. It is highly gratifying to acquire correct informa-<lb break="no"/>tion of this neighbouring region, about which, we have<lb break="yes"/>heretofore known so little. Its extent and jurisdiction are<lb break="yes"/>pourtrayed in Vol. 2. p. 182 and seq. The natural position<lb break="yes"/>and civil arrangement of this vast region are described in a<lb break="yes" />manner <choice><sic>two</sic><corr type="editorial">too</corr></choice> interesting to the Fredish citizen to be passed<lb break="yes"/>over. We therefore insert it, as it forms the tenth article<lb break="yes"/>of his statistical analysis.</p>

                            <p>&#x201C;This intendancy comprehends the whole of the north-<lb break="no"/>east part of the kingdom of New Spain. As it borders<lb break="yes"/>either on desert countries, or countries inhabited by wan-<lb break="no"/>dering and independent Indians, we may say that its nor-<lb break="no"/>thern limits are hardly determined. The mountainous<lb break="yes"/>tract called the <hi rendition="#i">Bolson de Mapimi</hi> includes more than 3,000<lb break="yes"/>square leagues, from which the Apachis sally out to attack<lb break="yes"/>the colonists of Cohahuila and New Biscay. Indented in-<lb break="no"/>to these two provinces, and bounded on the north by the<lb break="yes"/>great Rio del Norte, the Bolson de Mapimi is sometimes<lb break="yes"/>considered as a country not conquered by the Spaniards,<lb break="yes"/>and sometimes as composing a part of the intendancy of<lb break="yes" />Durango. I have traced the limits of Cohahuila and Tex-<lb break="no"/>as, near the mouth of the Rio Puerco, and towards the<lb break="yes"/>sources of the Rio de San Saba, as I found them indicat-<lb break="no"/>ed in the special maps preserved in the archives of the vice-<lb break="no"/>royalty, and drawn up by engineers in the Spanish service.<lb break="yes"/>But how is it possible to determine territorial limits in<lb break="yes"/>immense savannas, where the farms are from 15 to 20<lb break="yes"/>leagues distant from one another, and where almost no trace<lb break="yes" />of cultivation is any where to be found?</p>

                            <p>&#x201C;It follows from what we have already said on the latest<lb break="yes"/>changes which have taken place in the organization of the<lb break="yes"/>
                                <hi rendition="#i">Comandancia general</hi> of Chihuahua, that the intendancy<lb break="yes"/>of San Luis now includes, besides the province of Potosi,<lb break="yes"/>all which goes under the denomination of <hi rendition="#i">Provincias inter-<lb break="no" />nas Orientales.</hi> A single intendant is consequently at the<lb break="yes"/>head of an administration which includes a greater surface<lb break="yes"/>than all European Spain. But this immense country, gift-<lb break="no"/>ed by nature with the most precious productions, and si-<lb break="no"/>tuated under a serene sky in the temperate zone, towards<lb break="yes"/>the borders of the tropic, is, for the greatest part, a wild<lb break="yes" />desert, still more thinly peopled than the governments of<lb break="yes"/>Asiatic Russia. Its position on the eastern limits of New<lb break="yes"/>Spain, the proximity of the United States, the frequency<lb break="yes"/>of communication with the colonists of Louisiana, and a<lb break="yes"/>great number of circumstances which I shall not endeavour<lb break="yes"/>here to develop, will probably soon favour the progress of<lb break="yes"/>civilization and prosperity in these vast and fertile regions.</p>
                            <lb break="yes"/>
                            <p>&#x201C;The intendancy of San Luis comprehends more than<lb break="yes"/>230 leagues of coast, an extent equal to that from Genoa<lb break="yes"/>to Reggio in Calabria. But all this coast is without com-<lb break="no"/>merce and without activity, with the exception of a few<lb break="yes"/>
                                <pb n="357" facs="#f0034"/>small vessels, which come from the West Indies to lay in<lb break="yes"/>provisions either at the Bar of Tampico, near Panuco, or<lb break="yes"/>at the anchorage of New Santander. That part which ex-<lb break="no"/>tends from the mouth of the great Rio del Norte to the<lb break="yes"/>Rio Sabina is almost still unknown, and has never been ex-<lb break="no"/>amined by navigators. It would be of great importance,<lb break="yes" />however, to discover a good port in this northern extremi-<lb break="no"/>ty of the gulf of Mexico. Unfortunately, the eastern coast<lb break="yes"/>of New Spain offers everywhere the same obstacles, a want<lb break="yes"/>of depth for vessels drawing more than <choice><sic>38 decimetres</sic><corr type="editorial">38 decimetres<note place="foot" n="*">12 Feet 5 6-10 Inches.</note></corr></choice> of<lb break="yes"/>water, bars at the mouths of the rivers, necks of land, and<lb break="yes"/>long islots, of which the direction is parallel to that of the<lb break="yes"/>continent, and which prevent all access to the interior ba-<lb break="no"/>sin. The shore of the provinces of Santander and Texas,<lb break="yes" />from the 21&#x00B0; to the 29&#x00B0; of latitude, is singularly festooned,<lb break="yes"/>and presents a succession of interior basins, from four to<lb break="yes"/>five leagues in breadth, and 40 to 50 in length. They go<lb break="yes"/>by the name of <hi rendition="#i" >lagunas,</hi> or salt water lakes. Some of them<lb break="yes" />(the Laguna de Tamiagua, for example) are completely<lb break="yes"/>shut in. Others, as the Laguna Madre, and the Laguna<lb break="yes"/>de San Bernardo, communicate by several channels with<lb break="yes"/>the ocean. The latter are of great advantage for a coast-<lb break="no"/>ing trade, as coasting vessels are there secure from the<lb break="yes"/>great swells of the ocean. It would be interesting for geo-<lb break="no"/>logy to examine on the spot if these lagunas have been<lb break="yes"/>formed by currents penetrating far into the country by ir-<lb break="no" />ruptions, or if these long and narrow islots, ranged parallel<lb break="yes"/>to the coast, are bars which have gradually risen above the<lb break="yes"/>mean level of the waters.</p>
                            <lb break="yes"/>
                            <p>&#x201C;Of the whole intendancy of San Luis Potosi, only that<lb break="yes"/>part which adjoins the province of Zacatecas, in which are<lb break="yes"/>the rich mines of Charcas, Guadalcazar, and Catorce, is a<lb break="yes"/>cold and mountainous country. The bishopric of Mon-<lb break="no"/>tery, which bears the pompous title of New Kingdom of<lb break="yes"/>Leon, Cohahuila, Santander, and Texas, are very low re-<lb break="no"/>gions; and there is very little undulation of surface in<lb break="yes"/>them. This soil is covered with secondary and alluvial<lb break="yes"/>formations. They possess an unequal climate, extremely<lb break="yes"/>hot in summer, and equally cold in winter, when the north<lb break="yes"/>winds drive before them columns of cold air from Canada<lb break="yes" />towards the torrid zone.</p>

                            <p>of Natchitoches (a county which is an integral part of the<lb break="yes"/>confederation of <placeName key="amerika">American republics</placeName>) have become the<lb break="yes"/>subject of a political discussion, equally tedious and un-<lb break="no" />profitable. Several members of the Congress of Washing-<lb break="no"/>ton were of opinion that the territory of Louisiana might<lb break="yes"/>be extended to the left bank of the Rio bravo del Norte.<lb break="yes"/>According to them, &#x201C;all the country called by the Mexi-<lb break="no"/>cans the province of Texas anciently belonged to Louisiana.<lb break="yes"/>Now the United States ought to possess this last province<lb break="yes"/>in the whole extent of rights in which it was possessed by<lb break="yes"/>France before its cession to Spain; and neither the new de-<lb break="no"/>nominations introduced by the viceroys of Mexico, nor<lb break="yes"/>the progress of population from Texas towards the east,<lb break="yes"/>can derogate from the lawful titles of the congress.&#x201D; Dur-<lb break="no"/>ing these debates, the American government did not fail fre-<lb break="no" />quently to adduce the establishment that M. de Lasale, a<lb break="yes"/>Frenchman, formed about the year 1685 near the bay of<lb break="yes"/>St. Bernard, without having appeared to encroach on the<lb break="yes"/>rights of the crown of Spain.</p>
                            <lb break="yes"/>
                            <p>&#x201C;But on examining carefully the general map which I<lb break="yes"/>have given of Mexico and the adjacent countries on the<lb break="yes"/>east, we shall see that there is still a great way from the<lb break="yes"/>bay of St. Bernard to the mouth of the Rio del Norte.<lb break="yes"/>Hence the Mexicans very justly allege in their favour, that<lb break="yes"/>the Spanish population of Texas is of a very old date, and<lb break="yes"/>that it was brought, in the early periods of the conquest,<lb break="yes"/>by Linares, Revilla and <persName key="munotcamargo_d" >Camargo</persName>, from the interior of<lb break="yes"/>New Spain; and that M. de Lasale, on disembarking to<lb break="yes"/>the west of the Mississippi, found Spaniards at that time<lb break="yes" />among the savages whom he endeavoured to combat. At<lb break="yes" />present, the intendant of San Luis Potosi considers the Rio<lb break="yes"/>Mermentas, or Mexicana, which flows into the Gulf of<lb break="yes"/>Mexico to the east of the Rio de Sabina, as the eastern<lb break="yes"/>limit of the province of Texas, and consequently of his<lb break="yes"/>whole intendancy.</p>
                            <lb break="yes"/>
                            <p>&#x201C;It may be useful to observe here, that this dispute as to<lb break="yes"/>the true boundaries of New Spain can only become of im-<lb break="no"/>portance when the country, brought into cultivation by the<lb break="yes"/>colonists of Louisiana, shall come in contact with the terri-<lb break="no"/>tory inhabited by Mexican colonists; when a village of the<lb break="yes"/>province of Texas shall be constructed near a village of the<lb break="yes" />county of the Opeloussas. Fort Clayborne, situated near<lb break="yes"/>the old Spanish mission of the Adayes (Adaes or Adaisses,<lb break="yes"/>
                                <pb n="359" facs="#f0036"/>on the Red River, is the settlement of Louisiana which<lb break="yes"/>approaches nearest to the military posts (<hi rendition="#i"><choice><sic>presidious</sic><corr type="editorial">presidios</corr></choice></hi>) of the<lb break="yes" />province of Texas; and yet there are nearly 68 leagues<lb break="yes"/>from the presidio of Nacogdoch to Fort Clayborne. Vast<lb break="yes"/>steppes, covered with gramina, serve for common boun-<lb break="no"/>daries between the <placeName key="vsa" >American confederation</placeName> and the Mexi-<lb break="no" />can territory. All the country to the west of the Missis-<lb break="no"/>sippi, from the Ox River to the Rio Colorado of Texas is<lb break="yes"/>uninhabited. These steppes, partly marshy, present ob-<lb break="no"/>stacles very easily overcome. We may consider them as<lb break="yes"/>an arm of the sea which separates adjoining coasts, but<lb break="yes"/>which the industry of new colonists will soon penetrate.<lb break="yes"/>In the United States the population of the <placeName key="atlantik">Atlantic</placeName> pro-<lb break="no"/>vinces flowed first towards the Ohio and the Tennessee,<lb break="yes"/>and then towards Louisiana. A part of this fluctuating<lb break="yes"/>population will soon move farther to the westward. The<lb break="yes"/>very name of Mexican territory will suggest the idea of<lb break="yes"/>proximity of mines; and on the banks of the Rio Mer-<lb break="no"/>mentas the American colonist will already in imagination<lb break="yes"/>possess a soil abounding in metallic wealth. This error,<lb break="yes"/>diffused among the lower people, will give rise to new emi-<lb break="no" />grations; and they will only learn very late that the famous<lb break="yes"/>mines of Catorce, which are the nearest to Louisiana, are<lb break="yes"/>still more than 300 leagues distant from it.</p>
                            <lb break="yes"/>
                            <p>&#x201C;Several of my Mexican friends have gone the road<lb break="yes"/>from New Orleans to the capital of New Spain. This<lb break="yes"/>road, opened by the inhabitants of Louisiana, who come<lb break="yes"/>to purchase horses in the provincias internas, is more than<lb break="yes"/>540 leagues in length, and is consequently equal to the dis-<lb break="no"/>tance from Madrid to Warsaw. This road is said to be<lb break="yes"/>very difficult from the want of water and habitations; but<lb break="yes" />it presents by no means the same natural difficulties as must<lb break="yes"/>be overcome in the tracks along the ridge of the Cordille-<lb break="no"/>ras from Santa Fe in New Granada to Quito, or from<lb break="yes"/>Quito to Cusco. It was by this road of Texas that an in-<lb break="no"/>trepid traveller, M. Pagés, captain in the French navy,<lb break="yes"/>went in 1767 from Louisiana to <placeName key="acapulco">Acapulco</placeName>. The details<lb break="yes"/>which he furnishes relative to the intendancy of San Luis<lb break="yes"/>Potosi, and the road from Queretaro to <placeName key="acapulco">Acapulco</placeName>, which<lb break="yes"/>I travelled thirty years afterwards, display great precision<lb break="yes"/>of mind and love of truth; but, unfortunately, this travel-<lb break="no"/>ler is so incorrect in the orthography of Mexican and Span-<lb break="no"/>ish names, that we can with difficulty find out from his de-<lb break="no"/>

The road<lb break="yes"/>from Louisiana to Mexico presents very few obstacles un-<lb break="no"/>til the Rio del Norte, and we only begin from the Saltillo<lb break="yes"/>to ascend towards the table-land of <placeName key="anahuac">Anahuac</placeName>. The declivi-<lb break="no"/>ty of the Cordillera is by no means rapid there; and we<lb break="yes"/>can have no doubt, considering the progress of civilization<lb break="yes"/>in the <placeName key="amerika">new continent</placeName>, that land communication will become<lb break="yes"/>gradually very frequent between the United States and<lb break="yes"/>New Spain. Public coaches will one day roll on from<lb break="yes"/>Philadelphia and Washington to Mexico and <placeName key="acapulco">Acapulco</placeName>.</p>

                            <p>&#x201C;The three counties of the state of Louisiana, or New<lb break="yes"/>Orleans, which approach nearest to the desert country con-<lb break="no"/>sidered as the eastern limit of the province of Texas, are,<lb break="yes"/>reckoning from south to north, the counties of the Attacap-<lb break="no"/>pas, of the Opeloussas, and of the Nachitoches. The la-<lb break="no"/>test settlements of Louisiana are on a meridian which is<lb break="yes" />twenty-five leagues east from the mouth of the Rio Mer-<lb break="no"/>mentas. The most northern town is Fort Clayborne of<lb break="yes"/>Natchitoches, seven leagues east from the old situation of<lb break="yes"/>the mission of the Adayes. To the north-east of Clay-<lb break="no"/>borne is the <hi rendition="#i" >Spanish Lake,</hi> in the midst of which there is a<lb break="yes"/>great rock covered with stalactites. Following this lake to<lb break="yes"/>the south-south-east, we meet in the extremities of this fine<lb break="yes"/>country, brought into cultivation by colonists of French<lb break="yes"/>origin, first, with the small village of St. Landry, three<lb break="yes"/>leagues to the north of the sources of the Rio Mermentas;<lb break="yes" />then the plantation of S. Martin; and, lastly, New Iberia,<lb break="yes"/>on the river Teche, near the canal of Bontet, which leads to<lb break="yes"/>the lake of Tase. As there is no Mexican settlement be-<lb break="no"/>yond the eastern bank of the Rio Sabina, it follows that<lb break="yes"/>the uninhabited country which separates the villages of<lb break="yes"/>Louisiana from the missions of Texas amounts to more<lb break="yes"/>than 1,500 square leagues. The most southern part of<lb break="yes"/>these savannas, between the bay of Carcusin and the bay<lb break="yes"/>of la Sabina, presents nothing but impassable marshes.<lb break="yes"/>The road from Louisiana to Mexico goes therefore farther<lb break="yes" />to the north, and follows the parallel of the 32d degree.<lb break="yes"/>From Natchez travellers strike to the north of the lake<lb break="yes"/>Cataouillou, by Fort Clayborne of Natchitoches; and from<lb break="yes"/>thence they pass by the old situation of the Adayes to Chi-<lb break="no"/>chi, and the fountain of Father Gama. An able engineer,<lb break="yes"/>M. Lafond, whose map throws much light on these coun-<lb break="no"/>tries, observes, that eight leagues north from the post of<lb break="yes"/>
                                <pb n="361" facs="#f0038"/>Chichi there are hills abounding in coal, from which a sub-<lb break="no"/>terraneous noise is heard at a distance like the discharge of<lb break="yes"/>artillery. Does this curious phenomenon announce a dis-<lb break="no"/>engagement of hydrogen produced by a bed of coal in a<lb break="yes"/>state of inflammation? From the Adayes the road of Mex-<lb break="no"/>ico goes by San Antonio de Bejar, Loredo, (on the banks<lb break="yes" />of the Rio grande del Norte,) Saltillo, Charcas, San Luis<lb break="yes"/>Potosi, and Queretaro, to the capital of New Spain. Two<lb break="yes"/>months and a half are required to travel over this vast ex-<lb break="no"/>tent of country, in which, from the left bank of the Rio<lb break="yes"/>grande del Norte to Natchitoches we continually sleep<lb break="yes"/>
