<div n="1"><head><hi rendition="#k">Baron Humboldt on the Darien Canal Phoject.</hi></head><lb/><p>&#x2014;Humboldt, the celebrated traveller, has sent the fol-<lb/>lowing letter to Dr Cullen of
                    London, on the project of<lb/>the Isthmus of Darien Ship
                    Canal:&#x2014;&#x2018;Dr. Cullen cannot<lb/>doubt the high importance that I
                    would attach to the<lb/>merit of his courageous and useful investigations in
                    the<lb/>eastern part of the Isthmus of Panama; knowing my posi-<lb/>tion and my
                    antediluvian age, he will receive with indul-<lb/>gence, even so late, the
                    expression of my lively gratitude.<lb/>After having laboured in vain, during
                    half a century,<lb/>to prove the possibility of an oceanic canal, and to
                    point<lb/>out the Gulf of San Miguel and Cupica as the points<lb/>most worthy of
                    attention; after having regretted, almost<lb/>with bitterness, in the last
                    edition of my Aspects of Na-<lb/>ture, that the employment of the means which
                    the pre-<lb/>sent state of our knowledge affords for obtaining
                    precise<lb/>measurements has been so long delayed; I ought, more<lb/>than any
                    one else, to be satisfied to see, at last, my hopes<lb/>for so noble an
                    enterprise revived. By your publications,<lb/>sir, and by that of Mr Gisborne,
                    will be originated the<lb/>great work of changing an important part of the
                    com-<lb/>merce of nations, and of rendering more accessible the<lb/>rich
                    countries of Eastern Asia and the Indian Archipelago.<lb/>The undertaking is by
                    no means above the intellectual<lb/>and material power which civilised nations
                    have attained<lb/>to. The work should be one to last for ever; it should<lb/>not
                    commence with a canal with locks, like the magnifi-<lb/>cent Caledonian Canal;
                    it must be a really oceanic canal,<lb/>without locks; a free passage from sea to
                    sea, across<lb/>which the speed of the navigation will be modified, but<lb/>not
                    interrupted by the difference in height and non-coin-<lb/>cidence of the
                    tides.&#x2019;</p></div><lb/></body><back></back>
