                    former article.<lb/>The importance of this part of his paper is such as to
                    merit<lb/>the particular attention of our meteorological readers.</p>
                <lb/>
                <p>&#x201C;The question,&#x201D; says he, &#x201C;of the equatorial temperature
                    has<lb/>been recently discussed in a memoir published by Mr <persName ref="http://d-nb.info/gnd/">Atkinson</persName>,<lb/>in the
                    <bibl>second volume of the <hi rendition="#i">Memoirs of the Astronomical

                    judicious<lb/>considerations on several important points of meteorology.
                    The<lb/>learned author endeavours to deduce from my own observations,<lb/>by
                    employing the artifices of the most rigorous calculus, that the<lb/>mean
                    temperature of the equator is not less than 84°.5 Fahr.<lb/>and not 81°.5, as I
                    have supposed in my essay on isothermal<lb/>lines. <persName ref="http://d-nb.info/gnd/">Kirwan</persName> made it 84°, and Dr
                    <persName ref="http://d-nb.info/gnd/">Brewster</persName> in his Climateric<lb/>Formul&#x00E6; has adopted 82°.8. <note

                <p>If the equatorial temperature under consideration were that<lb/>of the equatorial
                    zone surrounding the whole globe, and bound-<lb/>ed by the parallel of 3° north
                    and 3° south, we must first ex-<lb/>amine the temperature of the equatorial
                    ocean, for there is only<lb/>one-sixth of the circumference of the globe which
                    in that zone<lb/>belongs to <hi rendition="#i">terra firma</hi>.</p>
                <lb/>
                <p>But the mean temperature of the ocean between the limits<lb/>we have mentioned,
                    varies in general between 80°.24, and 82°.4.<lb/>I say in general, for we
                    sometimes find between these limits<lb/><hi rendition="#i">maxima</hi>
                    restricted to zones scarcely a degree wide, and<lb/>whose temperature rises in
                    different longitudes from 83°.7, to<lb/>84°.7. I have observed this last
                    temperature, which may be<lb/>regarded as very high in the <placeName>Pacific ocean</placeName>, to the
                    east of the<lb/><placeName>Galapagos Islands</placeName>, and recently M. Baron <persName ref="http://d-nb.info/gnd/">Dirckinck of
                    Holm-<lb/>feldt</persName>, a well-informed officer of the Danish navy, who, at
                    my<lb/>request, made a great number of thermometrical observations,<lb/>has
                    found (in lat. 2°.5&#x2032; N., long. 81.°54&#x2032; W.) almost in
                    the<lb/>parallel of <placeName>Punta Guascama</placeName>, the surface of the water at 87°.1.<lb/>These
                    maxima do not belong to the equator itself. They oc-<lb/>cur sometimes to the
                    north, and sometimes to the south of it,<lb/>and often between the latitude of
                    2<formula notation="TeX">\frac{1}{2}</formula>°, and 6°. The great<lb/>circle which passes through the points where
                    the waters of the<lb/>sea are the warmest, cuts the equator at an angle which
                    seems<lb/>to vary with the sun&#x2019;s declination. In the <placeName>Atlantic ocean</placeName>,
                    we<lb/>may sometimes even pass from the northern to the southern<lb/>temperate
                    zone, in the zone of the warmest waters, without<lb/>observing the thermometer
                    rise above 82°.4. The maxima are</p>

                    5-6ths of the circumference of the globe, the equato-<lb/>rial aqueous zone,
                    instead of presenting a mean temperature of<lb/>84°.5, has probably not one of
                    83°.3. Mr <persName ref="http://d-nb.info/gnd/">Atkinson</persName> himself<lb/>admits, p. 171, that the union of the aqueous and
                    continental<lb/>parts tends to diminish the mean temperature of the
                    equator.<lb/>But in confining himself to the <placeName>continental plains of
                    south<lb/>America</placeName>, this philosopher adopts for the equatorial zone from<lb/>1°
                    to 3° south, and upon different theoretical suppositions,<lb/>84°.56, or 87°.8.
                    He founds this conclusion on the fact, that<lb/>at <placeName>Cumana</placeName>, in lat. 10°.27, the
                    mean temperature is 81°.68, and<lb/>that, by the law of the increase of heat
                    from the pole to the<lb/>equator, an increase which depends on the square of the
                    cosine<lb/>of the latitude,<note place="foot" n="*">The law of increase
                        approaches much more nearly to that of the simple<lb/>cosines of the
                        latitude.&#x2014;<hi rendition="#k"><persName ref="http://d-nb.info/gnd/">Ed.</persName></hi></note> the mean temperature
                    ought to be at least<lb/>above 84°.56. Mr <persName ref="http://d-nb.info/gnd/">Atkinson</persName> finds a confirmation of this
                    re-<lb/>sult, by reducing to the level of the equatorial seas
                    several<lb/>temperatures which I had observed on the declivity of
                    the<lb/><placeName>Cordilleras</placeName>, to a height of 500 toises; and in employing
                    cor-<lb/>rections, which he believes to be due to the latitude, and to
                    the<lb/>progressive diminution of heat in a vertical plane, he does
                    not<lb/>dissemble how much a part of these corrections is rendered<lb/>uncertain
                    by the position of places in vast plains, or in narrow<lb/>vallies.&#x2014;<bibl><hi

                <p>In studying in all its generality the problem of the distri-<lb/>bution of heat
                    on the surface of the globe, and in freeing it<lb/>of the accessory
                    consideration of localities, (for example of the<lb/>effects of the
                    configuration, the colour and the geographic re-<lb/>lation of the soil; of
                    those of the predominance of certain<lb/>winds, of the proximity of seas, of the

                    more or<lb/>less serene,) we shall find that the mean temperature of a
                    station<lb/>depends on the different ways in which the influence of
                    the<lb/>meridian altitude of the sun manifests itself. This
                    altitude<lb/>determines at once the duration of the semidiurnal arcs,
                    the<lb/>length and the transparency of the portion of the atmosphere<lb/>which

                    increases;) and lastly, the number of<lb/>solar rays which a given horizon

                    represents<lb/>the generality of the phenomena by approximation, and
                    often<lb/>in a satisfactory manner; but it cannot be employed against<lb/>the
                    testimony of direct observations. If the surface of the<lb/>globe, from the
                    equator to the parallel of <placeName>Cumana</placeName>, was a<lb/>desert like that of <placeName>Sahara</placeName>, or a
                    savanna uniformly covered with<lb/>grasses like the <placeName>Llanos of Calobozo</placeName> or of
                    <placeName>Apure</placeName>, there would<lb/>undoubtedly be an increment of mean temperature from
                    10<formula notation="TeX">\frac{1}{2}</formula>°.<lb/>of latitude to the equator, but it is very probable that
                    this<lb/>increase does not amount to 2<formula notation="TeX">\frac{1}{2}</formula>° of Fahrenheit. M.
                    <persName ref="http://d-nb.info/gnd/">Arago</persName>,<lb/>whose important and ingenious researches extend to all
                    the<lb/>branches of meteorology, has found, from direct experiments,<lb/>that
                    from a perpendicular incidence to 20° of zenith distance<lb/>the quantity of
                    reflected light is nearly the same. He has<lb/>found also that the
                    photrometrical effect of solar light varies<lb/>extremely little at <placeName>Paris</placeName> in the
                    month of August, from noon<lb/>to three o&#x2019;clock, in spite of the changes
                    in the length of the<lb/>path described by the rays which traverse the
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <lb/>
                <p>If I have fixed the mean temperature of the equator in<lb/>round numbers at
                    81<formula notation="TeX">\frac{1}{2}</formula>°., it was to attribute to the equatorial<lb/>zone, properly so
                    called, from 3° N. to 3° S., the mean tem-<lb/>perature of <placeName>Cumana</placeName>, 81°.86. This
                    city, surrounded with<lb/>arid sands, situated under a sky always serene, and
                    whose<lb/>thin vapours almost never resolve themselves into rains,
                    pos-<lb/>sesses a more burning climate than all the places which sur-<lb/>round
                    it, and which are like it on the level of the sea. In<lb/>advancing southward in
                    <placeName>America</placeName>, and to the equator, by the<lb/><placeName>Orinoco</placeName> and <placeName>Rio Negro</placeName>, the heat
                    diminishes, not on account<lb/>of the elevation of the soil, which from the <placeName>Fort
                    of St Carlos</placeName><lb/>is very little, but on account of the forests, the frequency
                    of<lb/>rains, and the transparency of the atmosphere. It is to be<lb/>regretted
                    that travellers, even the most laborious, should be<lb/>so little in a state to
                    advance the progress of meteorology, by<lb/>adding to our knowledge of mean
                    temperatures. They do<lb/><pb n="140" facs="#f0005"/> not remain a sufficient
                    time in the countries whose climate<lb/>they desire to know, and they collect
                    for the annual means<lb/>only observations which others have made, and most
                    frequent-<lb/>ly at hours and with instruments which are far from
                    giving<lb/>correct results. Owing to the constancy of the
                    atmospheric<lb/>phenomena under the zone nearest to the equator, a
                    short<lb/>space of time is without doubt sufficient to give approximate-<lb/>ly
                    the mean temperature at different heights above the level of<lb/>the sea.</p>
                <lb/>
                <p>I have always pursued this class of researches; but the on-<lb/>ly precise result
                    which I have been able to obtain, and which is<lb/>deduced from observations
                    made twice a-day, is that of <placeName>Cu-<lb/>mana</placeName>. (Compare with respect to the degree

                <p>It appears to result from these data, that the only place in<lb/>the equinoctial
                    region whose mean temperature exceeds 81°<lb/>86, is situated in 12° latitude.
                    This is <placeName>Pondicherry</placeName>, whose<lb/>climate can no more serve to characterise the
                    equatorial re-<lb/>gion than the <placeName>Oasis of Mourzouk</placeName>, where the

                    the thermometer at 117° and 128°, can characterise the<lb/>climate of the
                    temperate zone in the north of <placeName>Africa</placeName>. The<lb/>greatest mass of tropical land is
                    situated between 18° and 28°<lb/>of north lat., and it is in that zone also,
                    thanks to the esta-<lb/>blishment of so many rich commercial towns, that we
                    possess<lb/>most meteorological knowledge. The three or four degrees<lb/>nearest
                    to the equator are a <hi rendition="#i">terra incognita</hi> for

                <p>When we consider only the heat attained in a particular<lb/>part of the year, we
                    find in the northern hemisphere the most<lb/>scorching climates under the tropic
                    itself, and a little beyond it.<lb/>At <placeName>Abusheer</placeName>, for example, in lat.
                    28<formula notation="TeX">\frac{1}{2}</formula>°, the mean temperature<lb/>of the month of July is 93° 2. In the <placeName>Red

                    between <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, <placeName>Arabia</placeName>, and the <placeName>Gulf of<lb/>Persia</placeName>, is the simultaneous effect of
                    the configuration of the<lb/>surrounding lands, of the state of the surface, of
                    the constant<lb/>transparency of the air deprived of aqueous vapours, and
                    the<lb/>length of the days, which increase with the latitudes. Between<lb/>the

                    91° and at <placeName>Vera Cruz</placeName> 95°. It is almost<lb/>needless to state, that in this note
                    we have referred only to ob-<lb/>servations made in the shade, and far from the
                    reflection of<lb/>the ground. At the equator, where the two solstitial
                    heights<lb/>reach 66° 32&#x2032;, the times of the sun&#x2019;s passing the
                    zenith are<lb/>distant from one another 186 days. At <placeName>Cumana</placeName>, the height<lb/>at
                    the summer solstice is 76° 59, and that of the winter sol-<lb/>stice 56°
                    5&#x2032;, and the times of passing the zenith, 17th April<lb/>and 26th August,
                    are distant 131 days. Farther to the north,<lb/>at <placeName>the Havanna</placeName>, we find the
                    solstitial height in summer<lb/>89° 41&#x2032;, and of winter 43° 23&#x2032;,
                    and the distance of the passage<lb/>(12th June and 1st July) 19 days. If these
                    passages are not<lb/>recognized with the same evidence in the curve of the
                    month,<lb/>it is because their influence is marked in some places by
                    the<lb/>occurrence of the rainy season, and other electrical phenomena.<lb/>The
                    sun is at <placeName>Cumana</placeName> during 109 days, or more exactly dur-<lb/>ing 1275 hours, (from
                    the 28th October till the 14th Febru-<lb/>ary,) lower than under the equator,
                    but in this interval its<lb/>maximum of zenith distance does not exceed 33°.55.
                    The<lb/>retardation in the sun&#x2019;s progress, in approaching the
                    tropics,<lb/>increases the heat of places situated farther from the
                    equator,<lb/>particularly towards the confines of the torrid and
                    temperate<lb/>zones. Near the tropics, for example at <placeName>the Havanna</placeName>, lat.<lb/>23°
                    9&#x2032;, the sun employs twenty-four days to describe a degree<lb/>on each
                    side of the zenith; under the equator it requires on-<lb/><pb n="143"
                        facs="#f0008"/> ly five days. Near the tropics, for example at <placeName>the
                    Havanna</placeName>,<lb/>(lat. 23°29,) the sun employs twenty-four days to describe
                    a<lb/>degree on each side of the zenith; under the equator it em-<lb/>ploys only
                    five days. At <placeName>Paris</placeName>, lat. 48° 50&#x2032;, where the sun<lb/>descends to the
                    winter solstice, as far as 17° 42&#x2032;; the solstitial<lb/>height in summer
                    is 64°38&#x2032;. The sun is consequently from<lb/>the 1st of May till the 12th
                    August, during the interval of<lb/>103 days, or 1422 hours, as high at <placeName>Paris</placeName> as
                    at <placeName>Cumana</placeName> at an-<lb/>other epoch in the year. In comparing <placeName>Paris</placeName> to <placeName>the
                    Havanna</placeName>,<lb/>we find, in the first place, from the 26th March to the
                    17th<lb/>September, during 175 days, or 2407 hours, the sun as high<lb/>as it is
                    in any other season under the tropic of Cancer. But<lb/>in this interval of 175
                    days, the warmest month (July) has,<lb/>from the register kept in the royal
                    observatory from 1806 to<lb/>1820, a mean temperature of 65°.48, whilst at
                    <placeName>Cumana</placeName>, and<lb/>at <placeName>the Havanna</placeName>, where the sun descends, in the first place,
                    to<lb/>56°5&#x2032;, in the second, to 43°23&#x2032;, the coldest month still
                    gives,<lb/>in spite of the long nights at <placeName>Cumana</placeName>, 79°.16, and at <placeName>the
                    Ha-<lb/>vanna</placeName> 70°.16 of mean heat. Under all zones, the temperature<lb/>of a
                    part of the year is modified by the temperature of the<lb/>seasons which precede
                    it. Under the tropics the diminution<lb/>of the temperatures is very
                    inconsiderable, because the earth<lb/>has received in the foregoing months a
                    mass of mean heat,<lb/>which is equivalent at <placeName>Cumana</placeName> to 80°.6, and at <placeName>Havanna</placeName>
                    to<lb/>25°.5.</p>
                <lb/>
                <p>From the considerations which I have now explained, it<lb/>does not appear to me
                    probable that the equatorial tempera-<lb/>ture ever reaches 84°.56, as is
                    supposed by the learned and<lb/>estimable author of the <bibl>Memoir on <hi
                        rendition="#i">Astronomical Refractions</hi></bibl>.<lb/>Father <persName ref="http://d-nb.info/gnd/">Beza</persName>, who was the
                    first traveller who recommended<lb/>observations at the coldest and warmest
                    hours of the day, be-<lb/>lieved that he had found in 1686 and 1699, in
                    comparing<lb/><placeName>Siam</placeName>, <placeName>Malacca</placeName>, and <placeName>Batavia</placeName>, &#x201C;that the heat is not
                    greater<lb/>under the equator than under 14° of latitude.&#x201D; I am of
                    opi-<lb/>nion that there is a difference, but that it is very small,
                    and<lb/>masked by the effect of so many causes, which act simulta-<lb/>neously
                    on the mean temperature of a place. The observa-<lb/>tions hitherto collected do
                    not afford us any measure of a pro-<lb/><pb n="144" facs="#f0009"/> gressive
                    increase between the equator and the latitude of <placeName>Cu-<lb/>mana</placeName>.&#x201D;</p>
