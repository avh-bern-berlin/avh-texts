    <p>Baron de Humboldt has addressed the following note to the<lb/>
        Berlin journals:&#x2014;Overwhelmed by the number of letters sent<lb/>
        me, which are increasing every day, amounting to from 1,600<lb/>
        to 2,000 per annum,&#x2014;many, too, being on the most futile<lb/>
        subjects, such as demands for my autograph and offers to cure<lb/>
        me of all diseases,&#x2014;I once more make a public appeal to the<lb/>
        persons who wish me well, and request them not to occupy<lb/>
        themselves so much with what concerns me, in order that with<lb/>
        the diminution of strength, physical and intellectual, which I<lb/>
        experience, I may be allowed a little leisure for study and<lb/>
        composition. I trust that this step, to which I have recourse<lb/>
        with reluctance, will not be interpreted unkindly.&#x201D;</p><lb/></body><back></back>
