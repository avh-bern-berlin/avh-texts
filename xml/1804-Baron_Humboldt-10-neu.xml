                    <hi rendition="#i">The following abstract of the American travels of<lb break="yes"/>the celebrated Baron <persName key="humboldt_av" >Humboldt</persName> and his companion<lb break="yes"/>
                        <persName key="bonpland_ajag">Bonpland</persName>, has been drawn up from notes which<lb break="yes"/>the former has kindly furnished, and will super-<lb break="no"/>cede the many very incorrect accounts hitherto<lb break="yes"/>published relative to this interesting object</hi>.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>BARON HUMBOLDT, having travelled<lb break="yes"/>from the year 1790, as a naturalist, through Ger-<lb break="no"/>many, Poland, France, Switzerland, and through<lb break="yes"/>parts of England, Italy, Hungary, and Spain,<lb break="yes"/>came to Paris in 1798, when he received an in-<lb break="no" />vitation, from the directors of the national muse-<lb break="no"/>um, to accompany captain <persName key="baudin_tn">Baudin</persName> in his voyage<lb break="yes"/>round the world. Citizen <persName key="bonpland_ajag" >Alexander Aime Gour-<lb break="no"/>jon Bonpland</persName>, a native of Rochelle, and brought<lb break="yes"/>up in the Paris museum, was also to have accom-<lb break="no"/>panied them; when on the point of departing,<lb break="yes"/>the whole plan was suspended until a favourable<lb break="yes" />opportunity, owing to the re-commencement of<lb break="yes"/>the war with Austria, and the consequent want<lb break="yes"/>of funds.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Mr. <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName>, who, from 1792, had conceiv-<lb break="no"/>ed the plan of travelling through India at his own<lb break="yes"/>expence, with a view of adding to the knowledge<lb break="yes"/>of the sciences connected with natural history,<lb break="yes" />then resolved to follow the learned men, who had<lb break="yes"/>gone on the expedition to <placeName key="aegypten">Egypt</placeName>.&#x2014;His plan was<lb break="yes"/>to go to <placeName key="algier">Algiers</placeName> in the Swedish frigate which car-<lb break="no"/>ried the consul <persName key="skjoldebrand_ma">Skoldebrandt</persName>, to follow the cara-<lb break="no"/>van which goes from <placeName key="algier">Algiers</placeName> to Mecca, going<lb break="yes"/>through <placeName key="aegypten" >Egypt</placeName> to <placeName key="arabien">Arabia</placeName>, and thence by the Per-<lb break="no"/>sian gulph to the English East-India establish-<lb break="no"/>ments. The war which unexpectedly broke out<lb break="yes"/>in October, 1798, between France and the Bar-<lb break="no" />bary powers, and the troubles in the East, pre-<lb break="no"/>vented Mr. <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName> from embarking at Marseil-<lb break="no"/>les, where he had been fruitlessly two months<lb break="yes"/>waiting to proceed. Impatient at this delay, and<lb break="yes" />continuing firm in his determination to go to E-<lb break="no"/>gypt, he went to Spain, hoping to pass more rea-<lb break="no"/>dily under the Spanish flag from Carthagena<lb break="yes"/>to <placeName key="algier">Algiers</placeName> and Tunis. He took with him the<lb break="yes"/>large collection of philosophical, chemical, and as-<lb break="no"/>tronomical instruments, which he had purchased<lb break="yes"/>in England and France.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>From a happy concurrence of circumstances,<lb break="yes"/>he obtained in February, 1789, from the court of<lb break="yes"/>Madrid, a permission to visit <placeName key="spanischeskolonialreich">the Spanish colonies<lb break="yes" />of the two Americas</placeName>, a permission which was<lb break="yes" />granted with a liberality and frankness, which<lb break="yes"/>was honourable to the government and to a philo-<lb break="no"/>sophic age. After a residence of some months at<lb break="yes"/>the Spanish court, during which time the king<lb break="yes"/>showed a strong personal interest in the plan, Mr.<lb break="yes"/>
                    <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName>, in June, 1799, left Europe, accompa-<lb break="no"/>nied by Mr. <persName key="bonpland_ajag" >Bonpland</persName>, who, to a profound knowl-<lb break="no"/>edge in botany, and zoology, added an indefati-<lb break="no"/>gable zeal. It is with this friend that Mr. Hum-<lb break="no"/>boldt has accomplished his travels in the two<lb break="yes"/>
                    <cb/>hemispheres, by land and sea, probably the most<lb break="yes"/>extensive which any <hi rendition="#i">individual</hi> has ever under-<lb break="no" />taken.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>These two travellers left <placeName key="acoruna">Corunna</placeName> in the Span-<lb break="no"/>ish ship <persName key="pizzaro_f">Pizarro</persName>, for the Canary islands, where<lb break="yes"/>they ascended to the crater of the peak of Teyde,<lb break="yes"/>and made experiments on the analysis of the air.<lb break="yes"/>In July they arrived at the port of <choice>
                        <sic>Camana</sic>
                        <corr type="editorial">Cumana</corr>
                    </choice>, in<lb break="yes"/>
                    <placeName key="suedamerika">South America</placeName>. In 1799, 1800, they visited the<lb break="yes"/>coast of Paria, the missions of the Chaymas In-<lb break="no"/>dians, the province of New Andalusia (a country<lb break="yes" />which had been rent by the most dreadful earth-<lb break="no"/>quakes, the hottest, and yet the most healthy, in<lb break="yes"/>the world) of <placeName key="barcelona">New Barcelona</placeName>, of Venezuela, and<lb break="yes" />Spanish Guayana&#x2014;In January, 1800, they left<lb break="yes"/>Caraccas to visit the beautiful vallies of <placeName key="aragua">Aragua</placeName>,<lb break="yes"/>where the great lake of Valencia recals to the<lb break="yes" />mind the views of the lake of Geneva, embel-<lb break="no"/>lished by the majesty of the vegetation of the<lb break="yes"/>tropics. From Porto Cabello they crossed, to<lb break="yes"/>the south, the immense plains of Caloboza, of A-<lb break="no"/>pure, and of the Oronoco, also los Llanos, a des-<lb break="no"/>ert similar to those of <placeName key="afrika" >Africa</placeName>, where in the shade<lb break="yes"/>(by the reverberation of heat) the thermometer of<lb break="yes"/>
                    <persName key="reaumur_rafd">Reaumur</persName> rose to 35 and 37 (111 to 115 F.) de-<lb break="no"/>grees. The level of the country for 2000 square<lb break="yes"/>leagues does not differ five inches. The sand<lb break="yes" />every where represents the horizon of the sea<lb break="yes"/>without vegetation; and its dry bosom hides the<lb break="yes"/>crocodiles, and the torpid boas (a species of serpent.)<lb break="yes"/>The travelling here, as in all <placeName key="spanischeskolonialreich">Spanish America</placeName>,<lb break="yes"/>except Mexico, is performed on horseback&#x2014;They<lb break="yes"/>passed whole days without seeing a palm-tree or<lb break="yes" />the vestige of a human dwelling. At St. Fer-<lb break="no"/>nando de Apure, in the provinces of <placeName key="varinas">Varinas</placeName>, Messrs.<lb break="yes"/>
                    <persName key="humboldt_av">Humboldt</persName> and <persName key="bonpland_ajag">Bonpland</persName> began that fatiguing na-<lb break="no"/>vigation of nearly 1000 marine leagues, executed<lb break="yes" />in canoes, making a chart of the country by<lb break="yes"/>the assistance of chronometers, the satellites of<lb break="yes"/>Jupiter, and the lunar distances. They descend-<lb break="no"/>ed the <placeName key="apure">river Apure</placeName>, which empties itself into<lb break="yes"/>the Oronoco, in 7 degrees of latitude. They as-<lb break="no"/>cend the last river (passing the celebrated cata-<lb break="no"/>racts of Mapure and <placeName key="atures" >Atures</placeName>) to the mouth of the<lb break="yes"/>Guaviare. From thence they ascended the small<lb break="yes"/>rivers of <placeName key="atabapo">Tabapa</placeName>, Juamini, and Tenie. From<lb break="yes" />the mission of Sarita they crossed by land to the<lb break="yes"/>sources of the famous Rio Negro, which Conda-<lb break="no"/>mine saw, where it joins the <placeName key="amazonas">Amazon</placeName>, and which<lb break="yes"/>he calls a sea of fresh water. About 30 Indians<lb break="yes"/>carried their canoes through woods of Mami Le-<lb break="no"/>cythis and Laurus Cinamomoides to the cano (or<lb break="yes"/>creek) of Pemichin. It was by this small stream<lb break="yes"/>that the travellers entered the Rio Negro, or Black<lb break="yes"/>River, which they descended to St. Carlos, which<lb break="yes"/>has been erroneously supposed to be placed un-<lb break="no" />der the <placeName key="aequator">equator</placeName>, or just at the frontiers of Great<lb break="yes"/>Para, in the government of Brasil. A canal from<lb break="yes"/>Tenie to Pemichin, which from the level na-<lb break="no"/>ture of the ground is very practicable, would<lb break="yes" />present a fine internal communication between<lb break="yes"/>the Cara and the province of Carracas, a commu-<lb break="no"/>nication infinitely shorter than that of Cassiquiare<lb break="yes"/>&#x2014;From the fortress of St. Carlos on the Rio Ne-<lb break="no"/>gro, Mr. H. went north up that river and the<lb break="yes"/>Cassiquiare to the Oronoco, and on this river to<lb break="yes" />the volcano Daida or the mission of the Esmeral-<lb break="no"/>da, near the sources of the Oronoco: the Indians<lb break="yes"/>Guaicas (or race of men almost pigmies, very<lb break="yes"/>white and very warlike) render fruitless any<lb break="yes"/>attempts to reach the sources themselves.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>From the Esmeralda Messrs. H. and B. went<lb break="yes"/>down the Oronoco, when the water rose, to-<lb break="no"/>wards its mouth at St. Thomas de la Guayana, or<lb break="yes"/>the <placeName key="angostura">Angustura</placeName>. It was during this long naviga-<lb break="no"/>tion that they were in a continued state of suffer-<lb break="no"/>ing, from want of nourishment, and shelter from<lb break="yes"/>the night reigns, from living in the woods, from<lb break="yes"/>the musquetoes, and an infinite variety of stinging<lb break="yes"/>insects, and from the impossibility of bathing ow-<lb break="no"/>ing to the fierceness of the crocodile and the little<lb break="yes"/>crab fish, and finally the miasmata of a burning<lb break="yes" />climate. They returned to Cumana by the plains<lb break="yes"/>of Cari and the mission of the Carib Indians, a<lb break="yes"/>race of men very different from any other, and<lb break="yes"/>probably, after the Pategonians, the tallest and<lb break="yes"/>most robust in the world.</p>

                        <p>They had a fortunate passage, by the Pacific<lb break="yes"/>Ocean, to

                        <p>From Guanaxoato they returned to the valley<lb break="yes"/>of St. Jago
                            to Valadolid, in the ancient kingdom of<lb break="yes"/>Michuacan, one
                            of the most fertile and charming<lb break="yes"/>provinces of the
                            kingdom. They descended from<lb break="yes"/>Pascuaro towards the coast
                            of the Pacific Ocean<lb break="yes"/>to the plains of Serullo, where, in
                            1759, in one<lb break="yes"/>night, a volcano arose from the level,
                                surrounded<lb break="yes"/>by two thousand small mouths, from
                                whence<lb break="yes"/>smoke still continues to issue. They arrived
                                al-<lb break="no"/>most to the bottom of the crater of the volcano
                                of<lb break="yes"/>Serullo, of which they analized the air, and
                                found<lb break="yes"/>it strongly impregnated with carbonic acid.
                                They<lb break="yes"/>returned to Mexico by the valley of Teluca,
                                and<lb break="yes"/>visited the volcano to the highest point of
                                which<lb break="yes"/>they ascended 14,400 French feet above the

                        <p>In the months of January and February, 1804,<lb break="yes"/>they pursued
                            their researches on the eastern de-<lb break="no"/>scent of the
                            Cordilleras, they measured the moun-<lb break="no"/>tains Merados, de la

                            Orizaba, and the Cofer<lb break="yes"/>de Perote; upon the top of this
                            last, Mr. Hum-<lb break="no"/>boldt observed the meridian height of the
                                sun.<lb break="yes"/>In fine, after some residence at Xalappa,
                                they<lb break="yes"/>embarked at Vera Cruz, for the Havannah.<lb
