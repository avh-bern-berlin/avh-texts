<p>&#x2014;Baron de Humboldt has addressed the following note to<lb/>the Berlin
                journals:&#x2014;&#x201C;Overwhelmed by the number of let-<lb/>ters sent me, which
                are increasing every day, amounting to<lb/>from 1,600 to 2,000 per annum, many, too,
                being on the most<lb/>futile subjects, such as demands for my autograph, and
                offers<lb/>to cure me of all diseases, I once more make a public appeal<lb/>to the
                persons who wish me well, and request them not to<lb/>occupy themselves so much with
                what concerns me, in order<lb/>that, with the diminution of strength, physical and
                intellec-<lb/>tual, which I experience, I may be allowed a little leisure
                for<lb/>study and composition. I trust that this step, to which I<lb/>have recourse
                with much reluctance, will not be interpreted<lb/>unkindly.&#x201D;</p><lb/></body><back></back>
