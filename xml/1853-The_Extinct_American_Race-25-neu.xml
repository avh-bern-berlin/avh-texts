<div n="1"><head><hi rendition="#k">Extinct American Race.</hi></head><p>&#x2014;Amidst the plains of North America, some<lb/>powerful nation, which has disappeared,
                    constructed circular, square, and<lb/>octagonal, fortifications; walls, 6,000
                    toises in length; tumuli, from 700 to<lb/>800 feet in diameter, aud 140 feet in
                    height, sometimes round, sometimes<lb/>with several stories, and containing
                    thousands of skeletons. These skeletons<lb/>are the remains of men less slender
                    and more squat than the present in-<lb/>habitants of those countries. On a vast
                    space of ground at the Lower<lb/>Orinoco, as well as on the banks of the
                    Casiquiare, and between the sources<lb/>of the Essequibo and the Rio Branco,
                    there are rocks of granite covered<lb/>with symbolic figures. These sculptures
                    are the extinct remains which evi-<lb/>dently belonged to nations different from
                    those which now inhabit the same<lb/>regions.&#x2014;<hi rendition="#i"
