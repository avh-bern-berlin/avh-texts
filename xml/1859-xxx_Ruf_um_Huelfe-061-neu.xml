    <p>Baron de Humboldt has addressed the following<lb/>
        note to the Berlin journals:&#x2014;&#x201C;Overwhelmed by the num-<lb/>
        ber of letters sent me, and which are increasing every day,<lb/>
        amounting to from 1,600 to 2,000 per annum; many, too,<lb/>
        being on the most futile subjects&#x2014;such as demands for my<lb/>
        autograph, and offers to cure me of all diseases&#x2014;I once<lb/>
        more make a public appeal to the persons who wish me<lb/>
        well, and request them not to occupy themselves so much<lb/>
        with what concerns me, in order that, with the diminution<lb/>
        of strength, physical and intellectual, which I experience,<lb/>
        I may be allowed a little leisure for study and composition.<lb/>
        I trust that this step, to which I have recourse with reluc-<lb/>
        tance, will not be interpreted unkindly.&#x201D;</p><lb/></body><back></back>
