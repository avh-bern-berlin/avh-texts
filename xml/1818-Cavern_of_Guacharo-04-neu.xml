                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>In a country where the people love what is marvellous, a<lb break="yes"/>cavern that gives birth to a river, and is inhabited by thou-<lb break="no"/>
                    <pb n="141" facs="#f0002"/>sands of nocturnal birds, the fat of which is employed in the<lb break="yes"/>Missions to dress food, is an everlasting object of conversation<lb break="yes"/>and discussion. Scarcely has a stranger arrived at Cumana,<lb break="yes"/>when he is told of the stone of Araya for the eyes; of the la-<lb break="no"/>bourer of Arenas who suckled his child; and of the <hi rendition="#k">Cavern<lb break="yes"/>of Guacharo,</hi> which is said to be several leagues in length;<lb break="yes"/>till he is tired of hearing of them.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The Cueva del Guacharo is pierced in the vertical profile<lb break="yes"/>of a rock. The entrance is toward the south, and forms a<lb break="yes"/>vault eighty feet broad, and seventy-two feet high. The rock,<lb break="yes"/>that surmounts the grotto, is covered with trees of gigantic height.<lb break="yes"/>The mammee-tree, and the genipa with large and shining<lb break="yes"/>leaves, raise their branches vertically towards the sky; while<lb break="yes"/>those of the courbaril and the erythrina form, as they extend<lb break="yes"/>themselves, a thick vault of verdure. Plants of the family of<lb break="yes"/>pothos with succulent stems, oxalises, and orchide&#x00E6;, of a sin-<lb break="no"/>gular structure, rise in the driest cliffs of the rocks; while<lb break="yes" />creeping plants, waving in the winds, are interwoven in fes-<lb break="no" />toons before the opening of the cavern. We distinguished in<lb break="yes" />these festoons a bignonia of a violet blue, the purple dolichos,<lb break="yes"/>and, for the first time, that magnificent olandra, the orange flower<lb break="yes"/>of which has a fleshy tube more than four inches long. The<lb break="yes"/>entrances of grottoes, like the view of cascades, derive their<lb break="yes"/>principal charm from the situation, more or less majestic, in<lb break="yes"/>which they are placed, and which in some sort determines the<lb break="yes"/>character of the landscape. What a contrast between the<lb break="yes"/>Cueva of Caripe, and those caverns of the North, crowned<lb break="yes"/>with oaks and gloomy larch-trees!</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>But this luxury of vegetation embellishes not only the out-<lb break="no"/>side of the vault, it appears even in the vestibule of the grotto.<lb break="yes"/>We saw with astonishment, plantain-leaved heliconias eighteen<lb break="yes"/>feet high, the praga palm-tree, and arborescent arums, follow<lb break="yes"/>the banks of the river even to those subterranean places. The<lb break="yes" />vegetation continues in the cave of Caripe, as in those deep<lb break="yes" />crevices of the Andes, half excluded from the light of day;<lb break="yes" />and does not disappear, till, advancing into the interior, we<lb break="yes" />reach thirty or forty paces from the entrance. We measured<lb break="yes"/>the way by means of a cord: and we went on about four hun-<lb break="no"/>dred and thirty feet, without being obliged to light our torches.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Day-light penetrates into this region, because the grotto<lb break="yes"/>forms but one single channel, which keeps the same direction<lb break="yes"/>from southeast to northwest. Where the light begins to fail,<lb break="yes"/>we heard from afar the hoarse sounds of the nocturnal birds;<lb break="yes"/>sounds which the natives think belong exclusively to those sub-<lb break="no"/>terraneous places. The guacharo is of the size of our fowls,<lb break="yes"/>has the mouth of the goatsuckers and procnias, and the port<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="142" facs="#f0003"/>of those vultures, the crooked beak of which is surrounded<lb break="yes"/>with stiff silky hairs. It forms a new genus, very different<lb break="yes"/>from the goatsucker by the force of its voice, by the considera-<lb break="no"/>ble strength of its beak, containing a double tooth, by its feet<lb break="yes"/>without the membranes that unite the anterior phalanxes of the<lb break="yes"/>claws. In its manners, it has analogies both with the goat-<lb break="no"/>suckers and the alpine crow. The plumage of the guacharo<lb break="yes"/>is of a dark bluish-grey, mixed with small streaks and specks<lb break="yes"/>of black. It is difficult to form an idea of the horrible noise<lb break="yes"/>occasioned by thousands of these birds in the dark part of the<lb break="yes"/>cavern, and which can only be compared to the croaking of<lb break="yes"/>our crows, which, in the pine forests of the north, live in so-<lb break="no"/>ciety, and construct their nests upon trees, the tops of which<lb break="yes"/>touch each other. The shrill and piercing cries of the guacha-<lb break="no"/>roes strike upon the vaults of the rocks, and are repeated by the<lb break="yes"/>echo in the depth of the cavern. The Indians showed us the nests<lb break="yes"/>of these birds, by fixing torches to the end of a long pole. These<lb break="yes"/>nests were fifty or sixty feet high above our heads, in holes in the<lb break="yes"/>shape of funnels, with which the roof of the grotto is pierced like<lb break="yes"/>a sieve. The noise increased as we advanced, and the birds were<lb break="yes"/>affrighted by the light of the torches of copal. When this noise<lb break="yes"/>ceased around us, we heard at a distance the plaintive cries of<lb break="yes"/>the birds roosting in other ramifications of the cavern. It seem-<lb break="no"/>ed as if these bands answered each other alternately.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The Indians enter into the Cueva del Guacharo once a year,<lb break="yes"/>near mid-summer, armed with poles, by means of which, they<lb break="yes"/>destroy the greater part of the nests. At this season, several<lb break="yes"/>thousands of birds are killed; and the old ones, to defend their<lb break="yes"/>brood, hover around the heads of the savage Indians, uttering<lb break="yes"/>terrible cries, which would appal any heart but that of man in<lb break="yes"/>an untutored state.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>We followed, as we continued our progress through the ca-<lb break="no"/>vern, the banks of the small river which issued from it, and is<lb break="yes"/>from twenty-eight to thirty feet wide. We walked on the<lb break="yes"/>banks, as far as the hills, formed of calcareous incrustations,<lb break="yes"/>permitted us. When the torrent winds among very high<lb break="yes"/>masses of stalactites, we were often obliged to descend into its<lb break="yes"/>bed, which is only two feet in depth. We learnt with sur-<lb break="no"/>prise, that this subterraneous rivulet is the origin of the river<lb break="yes"/>Caripe, which, at a few leagues distance, after having joined<lb break="yes"/>the small river of Santa Maria, is navigable for canoes. It<lb break="yes"/>enters into the river Areo under the name of <hi rendition="#i">Canno de Tere-<lb break="no"/>zen.</hi> We found on the banks of the subterraneous rivulet a<lb break="yes"/>great quantity of palm-tree wood, the remains of trunks, on<lb break="yes"/>which the Indians climb to reach the nests hanging to the roofs<lb break="yes"/>of the cavern. The rings, formed by the vestiges of the old<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="143" facs="#f0004"/>footstalks of the leaves, furnish, as it were, the footsteps of a<lb break="yes"/>ladder perpendicularly placed.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The grotto of Caripe preserves the same direction, the same<lb break="yes" />breadth, and its primitive height of sixty or seventy feet, to the<lb break="yes"/>distance of 1458 feet, accurately measured. I have never seen<lb break="yes"/>a cavern in either continent, of so uniform and regular a con-<lb break="no"/>struction. We had great difficulty in persuading the Indians<lb break="yes"/>to pass beyond the outer part of the grotto, the only part which<lb break="yes"/>they annually visit to collect the fat. The whole authority of the<lb break="yes"/>missionaries was necessary, to induce them to advance as far as<lb break="yes"/>the spot where the soil rises abruptly at an inclination of sixty<lb break="yes"/>degrees, and where the torrent forms a small subterraneous<lb break="yes"/>cascade.<note place="foot" n="*">We find this phenomenon of a subterranean cascade, but on a<lb break="yes"/>much larger scale, in England, at Yordas cave, near Kingsdale, in<lb break="yes" />Yorkshire.</note> The natives connect mystic ideas with this cave,<lb break="yes"/>inhabited by nocturnal birds; they believe, that the souls of<lb break="yes"/>their ancestors sojourn in the deep recesses of the cavern.<lb break="yes"/>&#x201C;Man,&#x201D; say they, &#x201C;should avoid places which are enlighten-<lb break="no"/>ed neither by the sun, nor by the moon.&#x201D; To go and join the<lb break="yes"/>guacharoes, is to rejoin their fathers; is to die. The magicians<lb break="yes"/>and the poisoners perform their nocturnal tricks at the en-<lb break="no"/>trance of the cavern, to conjure the chief of the evil spirits.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>At the point where the river forms the subterraneous cas-<lb break="no"/>cade, a hill, covered with vegetation, which is opposite the<lb break="yes"/>opening of the grotto, presents itself in a very picturesque man-<lb break="no"/>ner. It appears at the extremity of a straight passage, 240<lb break="yes"/>toises in length. The stalactites, which descend from the<lb break="yes"/>vault, and which resemble columns suspended in the air, dis-<lb break="no"/>play themselves on a back-ground of verdure. The opening<lb break="yes"/>of the cavern appeared singularly contracted, when we saw it<lb break="yes"/>about the middle of the day, illumined by the vivid light reflect-<lb break="no"/>ed at once from the sky, the plants, and the rocks. The dis-<lb break="no"/>tant light of day formed somewhat of a magical contrast with<lb break="yes"/>the darkness that surrounded us in those vast caverns. We<lb break="yes"/>climbed, not without some difficulty, the small hill, whence<lb break="yes"/>the subterraneous rivulet descends. We saw that the grotto<lb break="yes"/>was perceptibly contracted, retaining only forty feet in its<lb break="yes"/>height; and that it continued stretching to the northeast, with-<lb break="no"/>out deviating from its primitive direction, which is parallel to<lb break="yes"/>that of the great valley of Caripe.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The missionaries, with all their authority, could not prevail<lb break="yes"/>on the Indians to penetrate farther into the cavern. As the<lb break="yes"/>vault grew lower, the cries of the guacharoes became more<lb break="yes"/>shrill. We were obliged to yield to the pusillanimity of our<lb break="yes"/>guides, and trace back our steps. We followed the course of<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="144" facs="#f0005"/>the torrent to go out of the cavern. Before our eyes were daz-<lb break="no"/>zled with the light of day, we saw, without the grotto, the wa-<lb break="no"/>ter of the river sparkling amid the foliage of the trees that con-<lb break="no"/>cealed it. It was like a picture placed in the distance, and to<lb break="yes"/>which the mouth of the cavern served as a frame. Having at<lb break="yes"/>length reached the entrance, and seated ourselves on the bank<lb break="yes"/>of the rivulet, we rested after our fatigues. We were glad to<lb break="yes"/>be beyond the hoarse cries of the birds, and to leave a place<lb break="yes"/>where darkness does not offer even the charms of silence and<lb break="yes"/>tranquility.</p>
