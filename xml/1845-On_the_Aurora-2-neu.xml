<div n="1"><head>ON THE LUMINOUSNESS OF THE EARTH.</head><lb/><p><hi rendition="#c"><hi rendition="#k">By Baron Von Humboldt.</hi></hi></p><lb/><p><hi rendition="#k">If</hi> the luminous phenomenon which we ascribe to a galvanic cur-<lb/>rent,
                        <hi rendition="#i">i. e.</hi>, a movement of electricity in a circuit
                    returning into<lb/>itself, be designated by the indefinite name of the Northern
                    light,<lb/>or the Polar light, nothing more is thereby implied than the local
                    di-<lb/>rection in which the beginning of a certain luminous phenomenon
                    is<lb/>most generally, but by no means invariably, seen. What gives
                    this<lb/>phenomenon its greatest importance, is the fact which it reveals,
                    viz.<lb/>that <hi rendition="#i">the earth is luminous;</hi> that our planet,
                    besides the light which it<lb/>receives from the central body, the sun, shows
                    itself capable of a pro-<lb/>per luminous act or process. The intensity of the
                    earth-light, or rather<lb/>the degree of luminosity which it diffuses, exceeds
                    by a little, in the<lb/>case of the brightest coloured rays that shoot up to the
                    zenith, the<lb/>light of the moon in her first quarter. Occasionally, as on the
                    7th<lb/>of January 1831, a printed page can be read without straining
                    the<lb/>sight. This light-process of the earth, which the Polar
                    regions<lb/>exhibit almost incessantly, leads us by analogy to the
                    remarkable<lb/>phenomenon which the planet Venus presents. The portion of
                    this<lb/>planet which is not illuminated by the sun, glows occasionally
                    with<lb/>a proper phosphorescent gleam. It is not improbable that the<lb/>moon,
                    Jupiter, and comets, besides the reflected sun-light recog-<lb/>nisable by the
                    polariscope, also emit light produced by themselves.<lb/>Without insisting on
                    the problematical, but very common phenome-<lb/>non of <hi rendition="#i"
                        >sheet-lightning</hi>, in which the whole of a deep massy cloud
                    is<lb/>flickeringly illuminated for several minutes at a time, we find
                    other<lb/>examples of terrestrial evolutions of light. To this head belong
                    the<lb/>celebrated <hi rendition="#i">dry-fogs</hi> of 1783 and 1831, which were
                    luminous by<lb/>night; the steady luminousness of large clouds, perfectly free
                    from<lb/>all flickering, observed by Rozier and Beccaria; and even the
                    pale<lb/>diffused light, as Arago has well observed, which serves to guide
                    us<lb/>in the open air, in thickly-clouded autumn and wintry nights,
                    when<lb/>there is neither moon nor star in the firmament, nor snow upon
                    the<lb/>ground. As in the phenomenon of the Polar light occurring in<lb/>high
                    northern latitudes, in other words, in electro-magnetic storms,<lb/>floods of
                    flickering, and often party-coloured light stream through<lb/>the air; so in the
                    hotter zones of the carth, between the tropics,<lb/>there are many thousand
                    square miles of ocean which are similarly<lb/>light-engendering. Here, however,
                    the magic of the light belongs<lb/>to the organic forces of nature.
                    Light-foaming flashes the bursting<lb/>wave, the wide level glows with lustrous
                    sparks, and every spark is<lb/>the vital motion of an invisible animal world. So
                    manifold is the<lb/>source of terrestrial light. And shall we conceive it
                    latent, not yet<lb/>set free in vapours, as a means of explaining Moser&#x2019;s
                        <hi rendition="#i">pictures</hi>&#x2014;<lb/>a discovery in which reality
                    still presents itself to us as a vision<lb/>shrouded in mystery?&#x2014;<hi
                        rendition="#i">Cosmos</hi>.</p></div><lb/></body><back></back>
