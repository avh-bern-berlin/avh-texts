<p>Baron de Humboldt has addressed the following note<lb/>to the Berlin journals:
                &#x201C;Overwhelmed by the num-<lb/>ber of letters sent me, which are increasing
                every day,<lb/>amounting to from 1,600 to 2,000 per annum&#x2014;many,<lb/>too,
                being on the most futile subjects, such as demands<lb/>for my autograph, and offers
                to cure me of all diseases<lb/>&#x2014;I once more make a public appeal to the
                persons<lb/>who wish me well, and request them not to occupy<lb/>themselves so much
                with what concerns me, in order<lb/>that with the diminution of strength, physical
                and in-<lb/>tellectual, which I experience, I may be allowed a<lb/>little leisure
                for study and composition. I trust that<lb/>this step, to which I have recourse with
                reluctance,<lb/>will not be interpreted unkindly.&#x201D;</p><lb/></body><back></back>
