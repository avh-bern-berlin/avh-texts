From the Red<lb break="yes" />river in the province of Texas (Rio Colorado) to<lb break="yes"/>the island of Tiburon, on the coast of the pro-<lb break="no"/>vince of La Sonora, is 364 leagues.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>That part of Mexico in which the two<lb break="yes"/>oceans, the <placeName key="atlantik">Atlantic</placeName> and the Pacific are<lb break="yes" />nearest to each other, is unfortunately not<lb break="yes"/>that in which the two ports of <placeName key="acapulco">Acapulco</placeName> and<lb break="yes" />Vera Cruz, and the capital of Mexico, are<lb break="yes"/>situated. According to my astronomical obser-<lb break="no"/>
                    <pb n="380" facs="#f0002"/>vations, there is from <placeName key="acapulco" >Acapulco</placeName> to Mexico an<lb break="yes"/>oblique distance of 2&#x00B0; 40&#x2032; 19&#x2033; of a great circle<lb break="yes"/>(or 155,885 toises); from Mexico to Vera Cruz<lb break="yes"/>2&#x00B0; 57&#x2032; 9&#x2033; (or 158,572 toises); and from the port<lb break="yes"/>of <placeName key="acapulco" >Acapulco</placeName> to the port of Vera Cruz, in a direct<lb break="yes" />line, 4&#x00B0; 10&#x2032; 7&#x2033;. It is in these distances that the<lb break="yes"/>old maps are the most faulty. According to the<lb break="yes" />observations published by Mr. <persName key="cassinidethury_cf" >Cassini</persName>, in the<lb break="yes"/>Journal of <persName key="chappedauteroche_j">Chappe&#x2019;s</persName> Voyage, the distance from<lb break="yes"/>Mexico to Vera Cruz is stated to be 5&#x00B0; 11&#x2032; of<lb break="yes"/>longitude, instead of 2&#x00B0; 57&#x2032;, which it has been<lb break="yes"/>found to be by more accurate observation.<lb break="yes" />Assuming for Vera Cruz the longitude given by<lb break="yes"/>
                    <persName key="chappedauteroche_j">Chappe</persName>, and for <placeName key="acapulco">Acapulco</placeName> that of the map of<lb break="yes"/>the French Dep&#x00F4;t of the Marine, compiled in<lb break="yes"/>1784, the breadth of the isthmus of Mexico,<lb break="yes"/>between the two ports, would be 175 leagues,<lb break="yes"/>which is 71 leagues too much.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The isthmus of Tehuantepec, to the south-<lb break="no"/>east of the port of Vera Cruz, is the part where<lb break="yes"/>the continent of New Spain is the narrowest;<lb break="yes"/>the distance being 45 leagues from the <placeName key="atlantik">Atlantic</placeName>
                    <lb break="yes"/>to the Pacific ocean. The proximity of the<lb break="yes" />sources of the rivers Huascualco and Chima-<lb break="no"/>lapa seems to favor the project of a canal for<lb break="yes"/>internal navigation, which was long meditated<lb break="yes"/>by Count <persName key="revillagigedo_jvgpdphyad" >Revillagigedo</persName>, one of the most intel-<lb break="no"/>ligent and active of the viceroys. When we<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="381" facs="#f0003"/>describe the province of Oaxaca, we shall re-<lb break="no"/>turn to this subject so important to all civilized<lb break="yes"/>Europe. We will here content ourselves with<lb break="yes" />considering the problem of the communication<lb break="yes"/>between the two rivers under the most general<lb break="yes"/>point of view. We shall present nine points<lb break="yes"/>which are not known in Europe, and all of<lb break="yes"/>which afford more or less easy means of facili-<lb break="no" />tating navigation, either by canals, or by inter-<lb break="no"/>nal communications between the rivers. At a<lb break="yes"/>moment when the <placeName key="amerika">new continent</placeName>, profiting by<lb break="yes"/>the misfortunes of Europe, and its perpetual<lb break="yes" />dissentions, makes rapid progress in civiliza-<lb break="no"/>tion; at a time when the commerce with China<lb break="yes"/>and the north-west coast of <placeName key="amerika">America</placeName> becomes<lb break="yes"/>from year to year more advantageous, the sub-<lb break="no"/>ject, which we here treat in a summary manner,<lb break="yes"/>is highly interesting for the balance of com-<lb break="no"/>merce and the political preponderance of na-<lb break="no"/>tions.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The nine points which I have marked in<lb break="yes"/>Plate IV. of my geographical and physical<lb break="yes"/>atlas, have at different periods attracted the<lb break="yes"/>attention of enlightened merchants and states-<lb break="no"/>men who have made a long stay in the colo-<lb break="no"/>nies: they present very different advantages.<lb break="yes"/>We shall arrange them according to their geo-<lb break="no"/>graphical position, commencing with the most<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="382" facs="#f0004"/>northern part of the New Continent, and fol-<lb break="no"/>low the coasts to the south of the isle of Chiloe.<lb break="yes"/>It is not till after we have examined <hi rendition="#i" >all</hi> the<lb break="yes"/>projects here formed for the communication of<lb break="yes"/>the two oceans, that we shall be able to decide<lb break="yes"/>which deserves the preference. Previous to this<lb break="yes" />examination, for which the correct materials<lb break="yes"/>are not yet collected, it would be imprudent<lb break="yes"/>to dig canals in the isthmuses of Huasacualco,<lb break="yes"/>of Nicaragua, of Panama, or of Cupica.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>I. Under 54&#x00B0; 37&#x2032; north latitude, in the pa-<lb break="no"/>rallel of Queen Charlotte&#x2019;s Island, the sources<lb break="yes"/>of the river de la Paix or Ounigigah (Unjigah)<lb break="yes"/>approach within seven leagues the sources of<lb break="yes"/>the Tacoutché Tesse, which was supposed to be<lb break="yes"/>the same as the river Columbia. The first of<lb break="yes" />these rivers empties itself into the Polar Sea,<lb break="yes"/>after having mingled its waters with those of<lb break="yes"/>Slave lake and Mackenzie river. The second<lb break="yes"/>river, the Columbia, falls into the Pacific ocean<lb break="yes"/>near Cape Disappointment, to the south of<lb break="yes" />Nootka Sound, and, according to the celebrated<lb break="yes"/>
                    <persName key="vancouver_g">Vancouver</persName>, in latitude 46&#x00B0; 19&#x2032;. The Cordillera<lb break="yes"/>of the Rocky Mountains, abounding in coals, was<lb break="yes"/>found by Mr. Fiedler to be 3520 English feet<lb break="yes"/>above the level of the neighbouring plains.<note place="foot" n="*" xml:id="n1" next="#n2">If it is true that this chain of mountains enters<lb break="yes"/>the limits of perpetual snow (Mackenzie, Vol. III.</note>

According to the account of Mac-<lb break="no" />kenzie, who crossed this chain in August 1793,<lb break="yes"/>the portage is tolerably practicable, and the<lb break="yes"/>mountains do not appear to be very elevated.<lb break="yes"/>To avoid the great detour which the Columbia<lb break="yes"/>makes, a shorter road for commerce might be<lb break="yes" />opened from the sources of the Tacoutché<lb break="yes"/>Tesse as far as Salmon river, the mouth of<lb break="yes"/>which is to the east of Princess Royal Islands,<lb break="yes"/>in latitude 52&#x00B0; 26&#x2032;. Mr. Mackenzie justly ob-<lb break="no"/>serves that a government which should open<lb break="yes" />this communication between the two oceans,<lb break="yes"/>forming regular establishments in the interior<lb break="yes"/>of the country, and at the extremities of the<lb break="yes"/>rivers, would thereby become master of the<lb break="yes"/>whole fur trade of <placeName key="nordamerika" >North-America</placeName>, from the<lb break="yes"/>48th degree of latitude to the pole, except that<lb break="yes"/>part of the coast which has long since been<lb break="yes"/>under the dominion of Russia.

The mouth of the river Co-<lb break="no" />lumbia seems to invite Europeans to establish<lb break="yes"/>a fine colony. The banks of this river are fer-<lb break="no"/>tile, and covered with fine timber. It must be<lb break="yes"/>confessed, however, notwithstanding the exami-<lb break="no"/>nation made by Mr. Broughton, only a very<lb break="yes"/>small part of the Columbia is yet known, which,<lb break="yes" />like the Severn and the Thames, appears to<lb break="yes"/>decrease extremely in breadth in proportion to<lb break="yes"/>the distance from the coast. Any geographer who<lb break="yes"/>will carefully compare the maps of Mackenzie<lb break="yes"/>with those of <persName key="vancouver_g">Vancouver</persName> will be surprised that the<lb break="yes"/>Columbia, descending from the Rocky Mountains<lb break="yes"/>which we are inclined to consider as a prolon-<lb break="no"/>gation of the <placeName key="anden">Andes</placeName> of Mexico, can traverse<lb break="yes"/>the chain of mountains which approaches the<lb break="yes"/>great ocean, and the principal summits of<lb break="yes" />which are mount St. Helen and mount Rainier.<lb break="yes"/>Mr. Malte Brun had already alleged important<lb break="yes"/>doubts against the identity of the Tacoutché<lb break="yes"/>Tessé and the Rio Columbia, before it was dis-<lb break="no"/>covered, as it now is, that the Columbia or Ore-<lb break="no" />gon is entirely different from the Tacoutché<lb break="yes"/>Tessé or Fraser&#x2019;s river.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>In latitude 50&#x00B0;, Nelson&#x2019;s river, the Saskasha-<lb break="no"/>wan and the Missouri, which may be regarded as<lb break="yes"/>one of the principal branches of the Missisippi,<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="385" facs="#f0007"/>furnish equal facilities of communication with<lb break="yes"/>the Pacific ocean. All these rivers rise at the foot<lb break="yes"/>of the Rocky Mountains. We have not yet any<lb break="yes" />sufficiently accurate data respecting the nature<lb break="yes"/>of the ground where the portage must be fixed,<lb break="yes"/>to decide on the utility of this communication.<lb break="yes"/>The expedition which Captain Lewis per-<lb break="no"/>formed at the expence of the Anglo-American<lb break="yes" />government on the Mississippi and Missouri,<lb break="yes"/>may throw great light on this interesting<lb break="yes"/>problem.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>II. In latitude 40&#x00B0;, the sources of the Rio del<lb break="yes"/>Norte or Rio Bravo, which falls into the Gulph<lb break="yes"/>of Mexico, are separated from the sources of<lb break="yes"/>the Rio Colorado by a mountainous district of<lb break="yes"/>twelve or thirteen leagues in breadth. This<lb break="yes" />tract is the continuation of the Cordillère des<lb break="yes"/>Grues, which extends towards Sierra Verde and<lb break="yes"/>the Lake of Timpanogos, celebrated in the his-<lb break="no"/>tory of Mexico. The Rio St. Raphael and the<lb break="yes"/>Rio St. Xavier are the principal sources of the<lb break="yes"/>river Zaguananas, which, with the Rio Nabajoa,<lb break="yes" />forms the Rio Colorada, and mingles its waters<lb break="yes"/>with those of the Gulph of California. The<lb break="yes"/>countries watered by these rivers abound in<lb break="yes"/>rock salt: they were examined in 1777 by<lb break="yes"/>Fathers Escalante and Antonia Velez, two<lb break="yes"/>monks of the order of Saint <persName key="franzvonassisi">Francis</persName>. How-<lb break="no"/>
                    <pb n="386" facs="#f0008"/>ever interesting the Rio Zaguananas and the<lb break="yes"/>Rio del Norte may one day become to the in-<lb break="no"/>land commerce of this northern part of New<lb break="yes"/>Spain, and however easy the portage across<lb break="yes"/>the mountains may be, no communication will<lb break="yes"/>ever result from it affording advantages equal<lb break="yes"/>to those of a canal between the two oceans.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>III. The isthmus of Tehuantepec, under the<lb break="yes"/>sixteenth degree of latitude, comprehends the<lb break="yes"/>sources of the Rio Huasacualco or Goazacoal-<lb break="no"/>cos, which falls into the Gulph of Mexico, and<lb break="yes"/>the sources of the Rio Chimalapa. The waters<lb break="yes"/>of this latter river mingle with those of the<lb break="yes"/>Pacific ocean near the barra de San Francisco.<lb break="yes"/>I consider here the Rio del Pasco as the prin-<lb break="no"/>cipal source of the river Huasacualco, though<lb break="yes"/>the latter does not take its name till it reaches<lb break="yes"/>the Passo de la Fabrica, after one of its arms,<lb break="yes" />which comes from the mountains de los<lb break="yes"/>Mixes, has joined the Rio del Passo. This<lb break="yes"/>isthmus of Tehuantepec is the point which <persName key="cortes_h">Fer-<lb break="no"/>dinand Cortes</persName>, in his letters to the Emperor<lb break="yes"/>
                    <persName key="karlv">Charles V.</persName> calls the secret of the strait, an ap-<lb break="no"/>pellation which sufficiently proves the impor-<lb break="no"/>tance attached to it at the commencement of<lb break="yes"/>the sixteenth century. It has again attracted<lb break="yes"/>the attention of navigators since the hostilities<lb break="yes"/>carried on by the castle of San Juan d&#x2019;Uloa<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="387" facs="#f0009"/>have caused the commerce of Vera Cruz to<lb break="yes"/>turn to the Barra d&#x2019;<placeName key="alvarado" >Alvarado</placeName> and to the coast<lb break="yes"/>of Tabasco, near the mouth of the Rio Huasa-<lb break="no"/>cualco. The ridge, which forms the division<lb break="yes"/>of the water between the two oceans, is inter-<lb break="no"/>rupted by a valley; but I much doubt whether<lb break="yes"/>in the time of the great inundations this valley<lb break="yes"/>is filled (as has been lately stated) with a quan-<lb break="no"/>tity of water sufficient to allow a natural pas-<lb break="no"/>sage for the boats of the natives. Similar tem-<lb break="no"/>porary communications exist between the ba-<lb break="no"/>sins of the Missisippi and the river Saint Law-<lb break="no" />rence, that is to say between Lake Erié and the<lb break="yes"/>Wabash, between Lake Michigan and the river<lb break="yes"/>of the Illinois. We shall return in the sequel<lb break="yes"/>to the possibility of digging a canal, six or seven<lb break="yes"/>leagues long, in the forests of Tarifa.<note place="foot" n="*">The Spanish Cortes decreed the opening of this<lb break="yes"/>canal in 1814. The execution of the canal was con-<lb break="no"/>fided to the Consulado de Guadalaxara, who proposed<lb break="yes"/>to issue an invitation to the capitalists of Europe.</note> Since a<lb break="yes"/>road was opened in 1798 from the port of Tehu-<lb break="no"/>antepec to the Embarcadero de la Cruz (which<lb break="yes" />road was improved in 1800), the river Huasa-<lb break="no"/>cualco forms a commercial communication be-<lb break="no"/>tween the two oceans. During the war with<lb break="yes"/>the English, the indigo of Guatimala, the most<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="388" facs="#f0010"/>valuable known, came by this isthmus to the port<lb break="yes"/>of Vera Cruz, and thence to Europe.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>IV. The great Lake of Nicaragua communi-<lb break="no"/>cates not only with the Lake of Leon, but<lb break="yes"/>also on the east, by the river San Juan, with<lb break="yes"/>the <placeName key="antillischesmeer">sea of the Antilles</placeName>. The communication<lb break="yes"/>with the Pacific ocean would be effected by<lb break="yes"/>digging a canal across the isthmus which sepa-<lb break="no"/>rates the lake from the gulph of Papagayo.<lb break="yes"/>On this narrow isthmus are the volcanic and<lb break="yes" />insulated summits of Bombacho (in latitude 11&#x00B0;<lb break="yes"/>7&#x2032;) of Grenada and Papagayo (in latitude 10&#x00B0;<lb break="yes"/>50&#x2032;). Old maps even indicate a communication<lb break="yes"/>by water across the isthmus. Other maps,<lb break="yes"/>rather more recent, represent a river, under the<lb break="yes"/>name of the Rio Partido, one of the branches<lb break="yes"/>of which flows into the Pacific and the other<lb break="yes"/>into the lake Nicaragua. But this bifurcation<lb break="yes"/>seems very uncertain. It is not noticed in the<lb break="yes"/>latest maps published by the Spaniards and<lb break="yes"/>the English.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>In the archives of Madrid are several French<lb break="yes"/>and English Memoirs on the possibility of<lb break="yes"/>uniting lake Nicaragua with the Pacific ocean.<lb break="yes"/>The commerce, which the English carry on, on<lb break="yes"/>the Mosquito shore, has greatly contributed to<lb break="yes" />give celebrity to this project of making a com-<lb break="no"/>munication between the two seas. None of<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="389" facs="#f0011"/>these memoirs which have come to my know-<lb break="no"/>ledge clear up the principal point, which is<lb break="yes"/>the elevation of the ground of the isthmus.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>From the kingdom of New Grenada to the<lb break="yes"/>environs of the capital of Mexico, there is not<lb break="yes"/>a single mountain, plateau, or town, the ele-<lb break="no"/>vation of which above the surface of the sea<lb break="yes"/>is known to us. Is there an uninterrupted<lb break="yes"/>chain of mountains in the provinces of Vera-<lb break="no"/>gua and Nicaragua? Has this range, which is<lb break="yes"/>supposed to connect the <placeName key="anden">Andes</placeName> of Peru with<lb break="yes"/>the mountains of Mexico, its central chain to<lb break="yes"/>the east or the west of the Lake Nicaragua?<lb break="yes"/>Does the isthmus of Papagayo offer a moun-<lb break="no"/>tainous soil, or only a simple barrier? These<lb break="yes" />are problems, the solution of which is as inte-<lb break="no"/>resting to the statesman as to the geographer.<lb break="yes"/>The various works which have been published<lb break="yes"/>since the commencement of the wars for the<lb break="yes"/>independence of <placeName key="spanischeskolonialreich" >Spanish America</placeName> confine them-<lb break="no"/>selves to the same ideas developed in the first<lb break="yes"/>edition of this work; I except some useful in-<lb break="no"/>formation which Mr. Davis Robinson has given<lb break="yes"/>on the bar of the river of San Juan de Nicara-<lb break="no" />gua. He assures us that &#x201C;this bar has twelve<lb break="yes"/>feet of water, and that on one point only it has a<lb break="yes"/>narrow pass, twenty-five feet in depth.&#x201D; In<lb break="yes"/>the Rio de San Juan itself there are from four to<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="390" facs="#f0012"/>six fathoms; in the lake Nicaragua from three to<lb break="yes"/>eight fathoms. According to Mr. Robinson the<lb break="yes" />San Juan is navigable for brigs and schooners.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>There is not a spot upon the globe so full of<lb break="yes"/>volcanoes as this part of <placeName key="amerika">America</placeName>, from latitude<lb break="yes"/>11&#x00B0; to 13&#x00B0;; but it seems that the trachytic moun-<lb break="no" />tains, through which the subterraneous fire<lb break="yes"/>makes its way, forms only insulated groups,<lb break="yes"/>and that, separated from each other by vallies,<lb break="yes"/>they rise from the plain itself. It must not<lb break="yes"/>excite surprise that we were ignorant of facts of<lb break="yes"/>this importance, for we shall soon see that even<lb break="yes" />the height of the chain which traverses the<lb break="yes"/>isthmus of Panama is as little known now as it<lb break="yes"/>was before the invention of the barometer, and<lb break="yes"/>the application of that instrument in the mea-<lb break="no"/>surement of mountains. Perhaps too a com-<lb break="no" />munication between lake Nicaragua and the<lb break="yes"/>Pacific ocean might be made by lake Leon,<lb break="yes"/>by means of the river Tosta, which descends<lb break="yes"/>from the volcano of Telica, on the road from<lb break="yes"/>Leon to Realexo. In fact the ground does not<lb break="yes" />seem very high, and <persName key="dampier_01">Dampier&#x2019;s</persName> account of his<lb break="yes"/>voyage may infer that there is not a real chain<lb break="yes"/>of mountains between Lake Nicaragua and the<lb break="yes"/>South Sea. &#x201C;The coast of Nicoya,&#x201D; says this<lb break="yes"/>great navigator, &#x201C;is low, and overflowed at the<lb break="yes"/>time of high water. Between Realexo and<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="391" facs="#f0013"/>Leon you traverse a flat country, covered with<lb break="yes"/>Mango trees.&#x201D; The city of Leon itself is situ-<lb break="no"/>ated in a savannah. There is a small river,<lb break="yes" />which falling into the sea near Realexo,<lb break="yes"/>might facilitate the communication between<lb break="yes"/>that port and Leon. From the western bank of<lb break="yes"/>the lake Nicaragua, it is only four leagues to<lb break="yes"/>the bottom of the gulph of Papagayo, and seven<lb break="yes" />to that of Nicoya, which navigators call Caldera.<lb break="yes"/>
                    <persName key="dampier_01">Dampier</persName> expressly says that the ground between<lb break="yes"/>La Caldera and the lake is not very hilly, and<lb break="yes"/>for the most part a level plain.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The isthmus of Nicaragua, by the position of<lb break="yes"/>its inland lake, and the communication between<lb break="yes"/>this lake and the <placeName key="antillischesmeer">sea of the Antilles</placeName> by means of<lb break="yes"/>the Rio San Juan, has many features of resem-<lb break="no" />blance with the defile in the Highlands of Scot-<lb break="no"/>land, where the river Ness forms a natural com-<lb break="no"/>munication between the mountain lakes and<lb break="yes"/>the gulph of Murray. At Nicaragua, as in the<lb break="yes"/>Highlands, there is to the west merely a barrier<lb break="yes"/>to pass; to the east it would perhaps be suffi-<lb break="no" />cient to <hi rendition="#i">canalize</hi> the Rio San Juan, without<lb break="yes"/>deviating from the bed of the river, which has<lb break="yes" />no bars except in the dry season. If it is true<lb break="yes"/>that the isthmus to be crossed has a few hills<lb break="yes"/>where it is the narrowest, between the western<lb break="yes"/>bank of the Nicaragua, and the gulph of Papa-<lb break="no"/>
                    <pb n="392" facs="#f0014"/>gayo, it is on the other hand formed of uninter-<lb break="no"/>rupted savannahs and plains, affording an ex-<lb break="no" />cellent road for carriages, between the city of<lb break="yes"/>Leon and the coast of Realexo. It is the high<lb break="yes"/>road by which merchandise is sent from Guati-<lb break="no"/>mala to Leon, landing in the gulph of Fonseca<lb break="yes"/>or Amalapa, to the port of Conchagua. The<lb break="yes" />elevation of Lake Nicaragua above the South<lb break="yes"/>Sea is equal to the fall of the Rio San Juan in<lb break="yes"/>the course of thirty leagues: accordingly the<lb break="yes"/>elevation of this basin is so well known in the<lb break="yes"/>country that it was formerly regarded as an in-<lb break="no"/>surmountable obstacle to the execution of a canal.<lb break="yes"/>It was apprehended that it might cause either<lb break="yes" />an impetuous overflow towards the west, or a<lb break="yes"/>diminution of the water of the San Juan, which,<lb break="yes"/>during the dry season, has, above the antient<lb break="yes"/>castillo de San Carlos, several rapids, and the<lb break="yes"/>banks of which, during their present uncultivated<lb break="yes"/>state, are extremely unwholesome. The art of<lb break="yes" />the civil engineer is, however, sufficiently ad-<lb break="no"/>vanced in our days not to fear such dangers.<lb break="yes"/>The lake of Nicaragua may serve as the upper<lb break="yes"/>basin, as lake Oich on the Caledonian canal.<lb break="yes"/>Regulating sluices will admit into the canal<lb break="yes" />only sufficient water to feed it. The small differ-<lb break="no"/>ence of level supposed to exist between the <placeName key="antillischesmeer">sea<lb break="yes"/>of the Antilles</placeName> and the Pacific ocean, probably<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="393" facs="#f0015"/>arises only from the unequal height of the tides.<lb break="yes"/>A similar difference is observed between the two<lb break="yes" />seas which are united by the great Caledonian<lb break="yes"/>canal, and were it even six toises and perma-<lb break="no"/>nent, as that between the Mediterranean and<lb break="yes"/>the Red Sea, it would be no less favourable to<lb break="yes"/>a junction between the oceans. The winds<lb break="yes" />blow strong enough on lake Nicaragua to save<lb break="yes"/>the necessity of towing by steam-boats the ves-<lb break="no"/>sels which are to pass from one sea to the other;<lb break="yes"/>but the employment of steam would be very<lb break="yes"/>useful in voyages from Realexo or from Panama<lb break="yes" />to Guayaquil. During the months of August,<lb break="yes"/>September, and October, calms are alternate in<lb break="yes"/>these seas, with a wind blowing in a contrary<lb break="yes"/>direction to this voyage.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The coasts of Nicaragua are rather dangerous<lb break="yes"/>in the months of August, September, and Octo-<lb break="no"/>ber, on account of the winds and terrible rain;<lb break="yes"/>in January and February, on account of the<lb break="yes"/>violent north-east and east north-east winds,<lb break="yes" />which are called by the name of Papagayos.<lb break="yes"/>This circumstance renders navigation very in-<lb break="no"/>convenient. The port of Tehuantepec, in the<lb break="yes"/>isthmus of Huasacualco, is not more favoured<lb break="yes"/>by nature; it gives its name to the hurricanes<lb break="yes" />which blow from the north-west, and which<lb break="yes"/>make all vessels fly from the little ports of<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="394" facs="#f0016"/>Sabinas and Ventosa. It results from the above<lb break="yes"/>considerations that the possibility of the canal<lb break="yes" />of Nicaragua is threefold, namely, from that<lb break="yes"/>lake to the gulph Papagayo, from the same to<lb break="yes"/>the gulph of Nicoya, or from the lake of Leon<lb break="yes"/>or Managua to the mouth of the Rio de Tosta.<lb break="yes"/>The distance from the south-eastern extremity<lb break="yes" />of the lake of Nicaragua to the gulph of Nicoya<lb break="yes"/>is very differently laid down (from 25 to 48<lb break="yes"/>miles) in Arrowsmith&#x2019;s map of <placeName key="suedamerika">south America</placeName>,<lb break="yes"/>and the fine map in the Deposito Hidrografico at<lb break="yes"/>Madrid, which is called <placeName key="antillischesmeer">Mar de las Antillas</placeName>, 1809.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>V. The isthmus of Panama was crossed for<lb break="yes"/>the first time by Vasco Numez de Balbo, in the<lb break="yes"/>year 1513. Since this memorable epoch in the<lb break="yes"/>history of geographical discoveries, the project<lb break="yes"/>of a canal has been a very general subject of<lb break="yes" />consideration; yet even now, after the lapse of<lb break="yes"/>three centuries, there is no survey of the ground,<lb break="yes"/>nor any very correct determination of the exact<lb break="yes"/>position of Panama and Portobello. The longi-<lb break="no"/>tude of the first of these two ports has been<lb break="yes"/>referred from Carthagena; that of the second<lb break="yes"/>has been determined from Guayaquil. The<lb break="yes" />operations of <persName key="fidalgo_jfd">Fidalgo</persName> and <persName key="malaspina_a">Malaspina</persName> are doubt-<lb break="no"/>less entitled to great confidence: but errors mul-<lb break="no"/>tiply insensibly when by chronometrical opera-<lb break="no"/>tions which embrace the whole coast of the<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="395" facs="#f0017"/>Terra Firma, from the isle of Trinidad to Por-<lb break="no"/>tobello, and from Lima to Panama, one po-<lb break="no"/>sition is made dependent upon another. To<lb break="yes"/>form an idea of the uncertainty which still<lb break="yes"/>prevails respecting the shape and breadth of<lb break="yes"/>the isthmus (for example at Nata) we need<lb break="yes"/>only compare the maps of Lopez with those<lb break="yes"/>of Arrowsmith and the most recent ones of the<lb break="yes"/>Deposito Hidrografico at Madrid. The river<lb break="yes"/>Chagre, which falls into the <placeName key="antillischesmeer">sea of the An-<lb break="no"/>tilles</placeName> to the west of Portobello, notwithstanding<lb break="yes"/>its sinuosities and rapids, presents many advan-<lb break="no"/>tages to commerce; it is 120 toises broad at its<lb break="yes"/>mouth, and 20 near Cruces, where it begins to<lb break="yes"/>be navigable. At present, ships ascend the Rio<lb break="yes" />Chagre from its mouth to Cruces, in four or five<lb break="yes"/>days. If the water is very high, they must con-<lb break="no"/>tend against the current for ten or twelve days.<lb break="yes"/>From Cruces to Panama the goods are conveyed<lb break="yes"/>on mules for five short leagues. The barometri-<lb break="no"/>cal measurements given in <persName key="ulloa_ad" >Ulloa</persName>&#x2019;s travels in-<lb break="no"/>duce me to suppose that there is in the Rio<lb break="yes"/>Chagre a difference of level of thirty-five to forty<lb break="yes"/>toises between <placeName key="antillischesmeer">the sea of the Antilles</placeName> and the<lb break="yes"/>Embarcadero or Venta de Cruces. This differ-<lb break="no" />ence must appear very small to those who have<lb break="yes"/>ascended the Rio Chagre; they forget that the<lb break="yes"/>strength of the current depends both on the great<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="396" facs="#f0018"/>accumulation of water near the sources, and on<lb break="yes"/>the general fall of the river, that is to say above<lb break="yes"/>Cruces. On comparing the barometrical level<lb break="yes"/>of <persName key="ulloa_ad">Ulloa</persName> with that which I made in the river<lb break="yes"/>Magdalena, we perceive that the elevation of<lb break="yes"/>Cruces above the ocean, far from being small, is<lb break="yes" />on the contrary very great. The fall of the Rio<lb break="yes"/>Magdalena from Honda to the dike of Mahates<lb break="yes"/>near Barancas is 160 toises, and yet this dis-<lb break="no"/>tance is not, as might be expected, four times,<lb break="yes"/>but eight times greater than from Cruces to<lb break="yes" />Fort Chagre.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The engineers who have proposed at the court<lb break="yes"/>of Madrid to establish a communication between<lb break="yes"/>the two oceans by the Rio Chagre have pro-<lb break="no"/>jected the digging of a canal from the Venta de<lb break="yes"/>Cruces to Panama. This canal would have to<lb break="yes" />pass through a mountainous tract, with the ele-<lb break="no"/>vation of which we are entirely <choice>

                        <corr type="editorial">ignorant</corr>
                </choice>. We<lb break="yes"/>only know that from Cruces there is first a rapid<lb break="yes"/>ascent and then a descent for several hours to-<lb break="no"/>wards the coasts of the South Sea. It is very<lb break="yes" />surprising that neither <persName key="lacondamine_cmd">La Condamine</persName> and<lb break="yes"/><choice><sic>Bonguer</sic><corr type="editorial">Bouguer</corr></choice>, nor Don <persName key="juanysantacilia_j">George Juan</persName> and <persName key="ulloa_ad" >Ulloa</persName>, had<lb break="yes"/>the curiosity, when they crossed the isthmus,<lb break="yes"/>to look at their barometers, to inform us what is<lb break="yes"/>the elevation of the highest point on the road<lb break="yes"/>from Fort Chagre to Panama. These gentle-<lb break="no"/>
                    <pb n="397" facs="#f0019"/>men remained three months in this region which<lb break="yes"/>is so interesting to the commercial world; but<lb break="yes" />their long stay has hardly added any thing to<lb break="yes"/>the observations of <persName key="dampier_01">Dampier</persName> and Wafer. It<lb break="yes" />seems indubitable that the principal chain, or<lb break="yes"/>rather range of hills, which may be considered<lb break="yes"/>as a prolongation of the <placeName key="anden">Andes</placeName> of New Grenada,<lb break="yes"/>is, between Cruces and Panama, nearer to the<lb break="yes"/>South Sea than to the <placeName key="antillischesmeer">sea of the Antilles</placeName>. It is<lb break="yes"/>from the summit of this range that persons have<lb break="yes" />pretended to see the two oceans at once, an<lb break="yes"/>observation which would not imply an absolute<lb break="yes"/>elevation of more than 290 metres. Lionel<lb break="yes"/>Wafer complains that he could not enjoy this<lb break="yes"/>spectacle; and he assures us that the hills, which<lb break="yes"/>form the central chain, are separated from each<lb break="yes" />other by vallies, which leave a free course for the<lb break="yes"/>rivers. If the last assertion be correct, we may<lb break="yes"/>believe in the possibility of a canal from Cruces<lb break="yes"/>to Panama, the navigation of which would be<lb break="yes"/>interrupted by only very few sluices.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>From some slight indications of the tem-<lb break="no"/>perature of these places, and the geography<lb break="yes"/>of the indigenous plants, I should be inclined<lb break="yes"/>to believe that the barrier in the road from<lb break="yes"/>Panama to Cruces does not attain an elevation<lb break="yes" />of 500 feet. Mr. Robinson supposes it to be<lb break="yes"/>400 feet at the most; besides, we find in almost<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="398" facs="#f0020"/>all mountainous countries, when carefully ex-<lb break="no"/>amined, instances of natural openings across<lb break="yes"/>the barriers. The hills between the basins of<lb break="yes"/>the Saone and the Loire, which the canal of the<lb break="yes"/>Centre would have had to pass, were 800 to 900<lb break="yes"/>feet high, but a defile or interruption at the<lb break="yes"/>pond of Long Pendu presented a ledge which is<lb break="yes"/>350 feet lower.</p>

                <p>There exist other points in which, according<lb break="yes"/>to memoirs drawn up in 1528, it has been pro-<lb break="no"/>posed to cut through the isthmus, namely, by<lb break="yes"/>joining the sources of the rivers called Caimito<lb break="yes"/>and Rio Grande, with the Rio Trinidad. The<lb break="yes" />eastern part of the isthmus is narrower, but the<lb break="yes"/>ground seems to be much more elevated. At<lb break="yes"/>least this is what we observe in the horrible<lb break="yes"/>road taken by the mail from Portobello to Pa-<lb break="no"/>nama. This road is two days&#x2019; journey, passes<lb break="yes"/>by the village of Pequeni, and presents very<lb break="yes" />great difficulties.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>In all ages and in all climates, people have<lb break="yes"/>believed that of two neighbouring seas, one was<lb break="yes"/>higher than the other. Traces of this vulgar<lb break="yes"/>opinion are found in the antient writers. <persName key="strabo">Strabo</persName>
                    <lb break="yes"/>says that it was supposed that the level of the<lb break="yes" />gulph of Corinth near Lech&#x0153;a was above that<lb break="yes"/>of the waters of the gulph of Cenchr&#x00E6;a. He<lb break="yes"/>imagined that it would be very dangerous to<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="399" facs="#f0021"/>cut through the isthmus, where the Corinthians,<lb break="yes"/>by the aid of particular machines, had esta-<lb break="no" />blished a <hi rendition="#i">portage.</hi> In the isthmus of Panama<lb break="yes"/>it is commonly supposed that the South Sea is<lb break="yes" />more elevated than the <placeName key="antillischesmeer">Sea of the Antilles</placeName>. This<lb break="yes"/>opinion is founded on a bare appearance. After<lb break="yes"/>having contended several-days against the cur-<lb break="no"/>rent of the Rio Chagre, we think we have as-<lb break="no"/>cended, much more than we afterwards descend,<lb break="yes" />the hills from Cruces to Panama. In fact, no-<lb break="no"/>thing is more deceitful than the opinion which<lb break="yes"/>we form, of a difference of level upon a long<lb break="yes"/>slope, which consequently is very gentle. In<lb break="yes"/>Peru I could hardly believe my eyes when I<lb break="yes" />found by my barometer that the city of Lima is<lb break="yes"/>91 toises above the port of Callao. The rock of<lb break="yes"/>the Isle of San Lorenzo must be entirely covered<lb break="yes"/>with water, in consequence of an earthquake,<lb break="yes"/>before the ocean could reach the capital of Peru.<lb break="yes"/>Don <persName key="juanysantacilia_j">George Juan</persName> has already combatted the<lb break="yes"/>opinion of a <choice>

                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The imperfection of the meteorological instru-<lb break="no"/>ments used at that time, may leave some doubts<lb break="yes"/>which even appear to have acquired more weight<lb break="yes"/>since the French engineers attached to the ex-<lb break="no"/>

                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The navigation of the Rio Chagre is difficult,<lb break="yes"/>not so much on account of the number of its<lb break="yes"/>sinuosities as of the celerity of its current, which<lb break="yes"/>is often one or two metres per second. The<lb break="yes"/>sinuosities however afford the advantage of a<lb break="yes" />counter-current, which is formed by eddies to-<lb break="no"/>wards the banks, and by means of which, small<lb break="yes"/>vessels, called Bongos and Chatas, ascend,<lb break="yes"/>either by means of oars and poles, or by tow-<lb break="no"/>ing. If these sinuosities were cut through, the<lb break="yes" />advantage would cease, and it would be very<lb break="yes"/>difficult to go from the <placeName key="antillischesmeer">Sea of the Antilles</placeName> to<lb break="yes"/>Cruces.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The minimum of the breadth of the isthmus<lb break="yes"/>of Panama is not fifteen miles, as marked by<lb break="yes"/>the first maps of the Deposito Hidrografico at<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="401" facs="#f0023"/>Madrid, but 25&#x00BC; miles, that is to say, 8&#x00BD; sea<lb break="yes"/>leagues, or 24,580 toises; for the dimensions of<lb break="yes"/>the gulph of San Blas, called also Ensenada de<lb break="yes"/>Mandinga, on account of the small river which<lb break="yes" />falls into it, have given rise to serious errors.<lb break="yes"/>This gulph enters seventeen miles less into the<lb break="yes"/>continent than was supposed in 1805, in the<lb break="yes"/>survey of the Mulatto Islands. Whatever confi-<lb break="no"/>dence the last astronomical observations seem to<lb break="yes"/>merit, on which the map of the isthmus, published<lb break="yes"/>by the Deposito Hidrografico in 1817 is founded,<lb break="yes" />it must not be forgotten that these operations<lb break="yes"/>comprehend only the Northern Coast, and that<lb break="yes"/>they have not yet been connected either by a series<lb break="yes"/>of triangles or chronometrically with the south-<lb break="no"/>ern coasts. Now the problem of the breadth of<lb break="yes"/>the isthmus does not depend on the determina-<lb break="no" />tion of the latitudes alone.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>From the whole of the information which I<lb break="yes"/>was able to procure during my stay at Cartha-<lb break="no"/>gena and Guayaquil; it seems that we must<lb break="yes"/>give up all hopes of a canal seven metres in<lb break="yes"/>depth, and from 22 to 28 in breadth, which<lb break="yes" />should traverse the isthmus of Panama from<lb break="yes"/>sea to sea, and receive the same vessels that<lb break="yes"/>trade between Europe and the East-Indies.<lb break="yes"/>The elevation of the ground would oblige the<lb break="yes"/>engineer to have recourse to subterraneous gal-<lb break="no"/>
                    <pb n="402" facs="#f0024"/>leries, or to sluices; consequently, the mer-<lb break="no"/>chandize intended to pass the isthmus of Pa-<lb break="no" />nama, must be conveyed in flat-bottomed boats,<lb break="yes"/>incapable of keeping the sea. Dep&#x00F4;ts would be<lb break="yes"/>necessary at Panama and Portobello. All na-<lb break="no"/>tions which should desire to carry on trade by<lb break="yes"/>this way, would become dependent on the nation<lb break="yes"/>who should be mistress of the isthmus and the<lb break="yes" />canal. This inconvenience would be very great,<lb break="yes"/>particularly for vessels dispatched from Europe.<lb break="yes"/>Even in case the canal should be dug, it is pro-<lb break="no"/>bable that the greater number of ships, fearing<lb break="yes"/>the delays caused by the numerous sluices,<lb break="yes"/>would still prefer the route by the Cape of Good<lb break="yes" />Hope. We see that the passage of the Sound<lb break="yes"/>is much frequented, notwithstanding the exis-<lb break="no"/>tence of the canal of the Eyder, which unites the<lb break="yes"/>ocean with the <placeName key="ostsee" >Baltic</placeName>.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>It would not be the same with the productions<lb break="yes"/>of Western <placeName key="amerika">America</placeName>, or the merchandize which<lb break="yes"/>Europe sends to the coasts of Quito and Peru or<lb break="yes" />the Pacific Ocean: these would cross the isth-<lb break="no"/>mus with less expense; and in time of war es-<lb break="no"/>pecially, with less danger, than by doubling the<lb break="yes"/>southern extremity of the <placeName key="amerika">new continent</placeName>. In<lb break="yes"/>the present state of the roads, the conveyance<lb break="yes"/>of three hundred weight on mules from Panama<lb break="yes"/>to Portobello, costs three or four piastres. But<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="403" facs="#f0025"/>the rude state in which the government has left<lb break="yes"/>the isthmus is such, that the number of beasts of<lb break="yes"/>burden from Panama to Cruces is much too<lb break="yes"/>small for the copper of Chili, the bark of Peru,<lb break="yes"/>and above all, the 70,000 fanegas of cocoa,<lb break="yes"/>which are annually exported from Guayaquil,<lb break="yes"/>to cross this slip of land; consequently, the<lb break="yes"/>slow, dangerous, and expensive navigation round<lb break="yes" />Cape Horn is preferred.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>In 1802 and 1803, when the English privateers<lb break="yes"/>everywhere hindered the commerce of Spain, a<lb break="yes"/>great part of the cocoa of Guayaquil was sent<lb break="yes"/>across the kingdom of New Spain, and shipped<lb break="yes"/>at Vera Cruz for Cadiz. The voyage from<lb break="yes" />Guayaquil to <placeName key="acapulco">Acapulco</placeName>, and a land journey of a<lb break="yes"/>hundred and thirty-five leagues from <placeName key="acapulco">Acapulco</placeName>
                    <lb break="yes"/>to Vera Cruz, was preferred to the danger of a<lb break="yes" />long passage by Cape Horn, and the difficulty of<lb break="yes"/>struggling against the currents along the coasts<lb break="yes"/>of Peru and Chili. This example proves, that if<lb break="yes"/>the construction of a canal, either across the<lb break="yes"/>isthmus of Panama, or that of Huasacualco,<lb break="yes"/>should be accompanied with too many difficul-<lb break="no" />ties, on account of the multiplicity of the sluices,<lb break="yes"/>the commerce of Western <placeName key="amerika">America</placeName> would gain<lb break="yes"/>prodigiously by good roads from Tehuantepec<lb break="yes"/>to the Embarcadero de la Cruz, and from Pa-<lb break="no"/>nama to Portobello. It is true that in the<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="404" facs="#f0026"/>Isthmus the pasturages are at present not favour-<lb break="no"/>able to the support and increase of cattle, but<lb break="yes" />in so fertile a country, it would be easy to make<lb break="yes"/>savannahs by cutting down the forests, or to<lb break="yes"/>cultivate the <hi rendition="#i" >Paspalum purpureum,</hi> the <hi rendition="#i">Milium<lb break="yes" />nigricans,</hi> and particularly the Luzerne (<hi rendition="#i">Me-<lb break="no"/>dicago sativa</hi>), which grows abundantly in Peru<lb break="yes"/>in the hottest parts. The introduction of camels<lb break="yes" />would be a means still more calculated to di-<lb break="no"/>minish the expenses of conveyance. These land<lb break="yes"/>ships, as the Orientals call them, are at present<lb break="yes"/>to be found only in the province of Caracas,<lb break="yes"/>where the <persName key="marquisdetoro_01">Marquis of Toro</persName> introduced them<lb break="yes"/>from the Canaries.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>No political consideration ought to oppose<lb break="yes"/>the progress of population, agriculture, com-<lb break="no"/>merce, and civilization in the isthmus of Pa-<lb break="no"/>nama. The more cultivated this tongue of<lb break="yes"/>land becomes, the more resistance it will oppose<lb break="yes" />to a foreign enemy. If some enterprising nation<lb break="yes"/>wished to make itself master of the isthmus, it<lb break="yes"/>could more easily do so in its present state.<lb break="yes"/>There are numerous fine fortifications destitute<lb break="yes"/>of arms to defend them. The insalubrity of<lb break="yes"/>the climate, though already diminished at Porto-<lb break="no" />bello, renders a military enterprize in the Isth-<lb break="no"/>mus difficult. It is from Saint Charles de Chiloe,<lb break="yes"/>and not from Panama, that Peru can be attacked.<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="405" facs="#f0027"/>It would take three or four months to advance<lb break="yes"/>against the currents from Panama to Lima,<lb break="yes" />whereas the navigation from Chili to Peru is<lb break="yes"/>easy and always rapid. Notwithstanding the<lb break="yes"/>disadvantages presented by the Isthmus, the<lb break="yes"/>possession of it is still of great importance to an<lb break="yes"/>enterprising nation. The whale fishery, which<lb break="yes"/>so far back as 1803, employed sixty English<lb break="yes" />vessels in the South Sea, the facility of the trade<lb break="yes"/>with China, and the furs of Nootka Sound, are<lb break="yes"/>very seducing temptations; they suffice, sooner<lb break="yes"/>or later, to attract the masters of the ocean to-<lb break="no"/>wards a point of the globe, which nature seems<lb break="yes"/>to have destined to effect a change in the com-<lb break="no"/>mercial system of nations.</p>

                <p>VI. To the south-east of Panama, following<lb break="yes"/>the coasts of the Pacific, from Cape St. Michael<lb break="yes"/>to Cape Corrientes, we come to the small port<lb break="yes"/>of Cupica. The name of this bay has become<lb break="yes"/>celebrated in the kingdom of New Grenada, on<lb break="yes" />account of a new plan for a communication be-<lb break="no"/>tween the two seas. From Cupica, we cross, for<lb break="yes"/>a distance of five or six sea leagues, a level<lb break="yes"/>tract<note place="foot" n="*" xml:id="n3" next="#n4">This information was communicated to me in<lb break="yes"/>1803, by an inhabitant of Carthagena: but the geo-<lb break="no"/>graphical position of Cupica is as uncertain as that of</note> very well adapted for a canal, which would<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="406" facs="#f0028"/>end at the Embarcadero of the Rio Naipi, or<lb break="yes"/>Naipipi. This latter river is navigable, and falls<lb break="yes"/>below the village of Zitara, into the <placeName key="atrato" >Rio Atrato</placeName>,<lb break="yes"/>which empties itself into the <placeName key="antillischesmeer">sea of the Antilles</placeName>.<lb break="yes"/>Mr. <persName key="gogueneche_01">Gogueneche</persName>, a very intelligent Biscayan<lb break="yes"/>pilot, has the merit of having first drawn the at-<lb break="no"/>tention of the government to this bay of Cupica;<lb break="yes"/>he attempted to prove that it might become to<lb break="yes" />the <placeName key="amerika">new world</placeName> what Suez had antiently been to<lb break="yes"/>

Mr. <persName key="gogueneche_01" >Gogueneche</persName> proposed to send all the<lb break="yes"/>cocoa of Guayaquil by the Naipi to Carthagena.<lb break="yes"/>The same channel offers the advantage of a very<lb break="yes"/>speedy communication between Cadiz and<lb break="yes"/>Lima. Instead of sending the mails by Cartha-<lb break="no"/>gena, Santa-Fé, or Quito, or by Buenos Ayres,<lb break="yes" />and Mendo&#x00E7;a, the dispatches should be sent by<lb break="yes"/>the mouths of the <placeName key="atrato">Atrato</placeName> to Cupica, and for-<lb break="no"/>warded by little swift sailing packet-boats from<lb break="yes" />Cupica to Peru. If this route had been opened,<lb break="yes"/>the viceroy of Lima would not sometimes have<lb break="yes"/>remained six months without receiving orders<lb break="yes"/>

The tract lying between Cupica<lb break="yes"/>and the mouth of the <placeName key="atrato">Atrato</placeName>, is perhaps the<lb break="yes" />only place in the whole of <placeName key="amerika">America</placeName> in which<lb break="yes"/>the chain of the <placeName key="anden" >Andes</placeName> is wholly interrupted.<lb break="yes"/>To form an idea of this extraordinary depres-<lb break="no"/>sion of the western Cordillera of New Grenada,<lb break="yes"/>we must recollect that in the second degree of<lb break="yes"/>latitude, in the assemblage of mountains which<lb break="yes" />contains the sources of the Rio Magdalena, the<lb break="yes"/>
                    <placeName key="anden">Andes</placeName> divide into three chains. The most east-<lb break="no"/>erly extends, deviating towards the north-east,<lb break="yes"/>by Timana, Bogota, and Pemplona, to the snowy<lb break="yes" />mountains of Merida: between lake Maracaybo<lb break="yes"/>and the city of Valencia, it joins the Cordillera,<lb break="yes"/>of the coast of Venezuela. The intermediate<lb break="yes"/>chain, that of Panama, Guanacas, and Quindiù,<lb break="yes"/>separates the longitudinal valley of the Rio<lb break="yes"/>Cauca from that of the Rio Magdalena. In the<lb break="yes" />province of <placeName key="antioquia">Antioquia</placeName>, it joins the most westerly<lb break="yes"/>chain of New Grenada, which gradually disap-<lb break="no"/>pears in the district of Choco, in latitude 7&#x00B0;, a<lb break="yes" />little to the west of Zitara, between the left bank<lb break="yes"/>of the <placeName key="atrato">Atrato</placeName>, and the shores of the Pacific. It<lb break="yes"/>would be interesting to know the configuration<lb break="yes"/>of the ground between Cape Garachine, or the<lb break="yes" />Gulph of Saint Michael, and Cape Tiburon, es-<lb break="no"/>pecially towards the sources of the Rio Tuyra<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="408" facs="#f0030"/>and Chucunaque, or Chuchunque, that we<lb break="yes"/>might determine with precision where the moun-<lb break="no" />tains of the isthmus of Panama commence, the<lb break="yes"/>line of whose summits appears to be not above<lb break="yes"/>a hundred toises in height. The interior of Dar-<lb break="no"/>four is not more unknown to geographers than<lb break="yes"/>the damp, unwholesome, and woody tract which<lb break="yes" />extends to the north-west of Betoi, and of<lb break="yes"/>the junction of the Bevara with the <placeName key="atrato">Atrato</placeName>, to-<lb break="no" />wards the isthmus of Panama. All that we<lb break="yes"/>positively know at present is that between<lb break="yes"/>Cupica and the left bank of the <placeName key="atrato">Atrato</placeName>, there is<lb break="yes"/>either a land strait (<hi rendition="#i">detroite terrestre</hi>), or a total<lb break="yes"/>absence of any chain. The mountains of the<lb break="yes" />isthmus of Panama, on account of their direc-<lb break="no"/>tion and geographical position, may be consi-<lb break="no"/>dered as a continuation of the mountains of the<lb break="yes"/>
                    <placeName key="antioquia">Antioquia</placeName> and Choco; but in the plains to the<lb break="yes"/>west of the lower <placeName key="atrato" >Atrato</placeName> there is scarcely a<lb break="yes"/>ledge, or a slight barrier. Between the isthmus<lb break="yes"/>and the Cordillera of <placeName key="antioquia">Antioquia</placeName>, there is not a<lb break="yes"/>group of the mountains, interposed like that which<lb break="yes"/>indubitably connects (between Barquesimeto,<lb break="yes"/>Nirgua, and Valencia), the eastern chain of<lb break="yes"/>New Grenada, (La Sierra de la Suma Paz,<lb break="yes"/>and the Sierra Nevada de Merida), to the Cor-<lb break="no" />dillera of the coast of Venezuela.</p>

                <p>VII. In the interior of the province of Choco,<lb break="yes"/>the little ravine (Quebrada) of the Raspadura<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="409" facs="#f0031"/>unites the Rio de Noanama, vulgarly called the<lb break="yes"/>Rio <choice><sic>Sant</sic><corr type="editorial">San</corr></choice> Juan, to the small river of Quibdo.<lb break="yes" />This latter, augmented by the waters of the<lb break="yes"/>Andagueda and the Rio Zitara, forms the <placeName key="atrato">Rio<lb break="yes" />Atrato</placeName>, which falls into <placeName key="antillischesmeer">the sea of the Antilles</placeName>,<lb break="yes"/>while the Rio San Juan empties itself into the<lb break="yes"/>Pacific. A very active monk, priest of the vil-<lb break="no"/>lage of Novita, caused his parishioners to dig a<lb break="yes"/>little canal in the ravine of the Raspadura. By<lb break="yes" />means of this canal, which is navigable during<lb break="yes"/>the rainy season, boats loaded with cocoa have<lb break="yes"/>passed from one sea to the other. Here then is<lb break="yes"/>an inland communication which has existed<lb break="yes"/>since 1788, and is unknown in Europe. The<lb break="yes"/>small canal of the Raspadura connects the<lb break="yes"/>coasts of the two oceans in two points above<lb break="yes"/>ninety-five leagues distant from each other. It<lb break="yes"/>will never be any thing more than a canal for<lb break="yes"/>boats; but it might be easily enlarged by joining<lb break="yes"/>to it the streams known by the name of Ca&#xf1;o de<lb break="yes"/>las Animas, del Caliche, and Aguaclaras. Re-<lb break="no" />servoirs and tributary channels are easily made<lb break="yes"/>in a country like Choco, where it rains all the<lb break="yes"/>year, and thunders every day. According to<lb break="yes"/>the information I obtained at Honda and Vilela,<lb break="yes"/>near Cali, from persons employed in the trade<lb break="yes" />of the gold dust from Choco, the Rio Quibdo,<lb break="yes"/>which communicates with the canal of Mina de<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="410" facs="#f0032"/>Raspadura, unites, near the village of Quibdo,<lb break="yes"/>(vulgarly called Zitara) with the Rio Zitara and<lb break="yes" />the Rio Andagueda; but, according to a manus-<lb break="no"/>cript map which I have just received from<lb break="yes"/>Choco, on which the canal of the Raspadura<lb break="yes"/>likewise joins (in latitude 5&#x00B0; 20&#x2032;) the Rio San<lb break="yes"/>Juan and the Rio Quibdo, a little above the<lb break="yes"/>mine of Animas, the village of Quibdo is placed<lb break="yes"/>at the confluence of the small river of this name<lb break="yes"/>with the <placeName key="atrato">Rio Atrato</placeName> which has received the Rio<lb break="yes"/>Andagueda, three leagues higher up near Lloro.<lb break="yes"/>From its mouth (lat. 4&#x00B0; 6&#x2032;) to the south of the<lb break="yes"/>point of the Charambira, the great Rio San<lb break="yes"/>Juan receives successively, in ascending towards<lb break="yes" />the N. N. E. the Rio Calima, the Rio del No,<lb break="yes"/>(above the village of Noanama) the Rio Ta-<lb break="no"/>mana, which flows near Novita, the Rio Iro, the<lb break="yes"/>Quebrada de San Pablo, and lastly, near the<lb break="yes"/>village of Tado, the Rio de la Platina. The<lb break="yes" />province of Choco is inhabited only on the<lb break="yes"/>banks of these rivers; it has commercial com-<lb break="no"/>munications towards the north with Carthagena,<lb break="yes"/>by the <placeName key="atrato" >Atrato</placeName>, the banks of which are entirely<lb break="yes" />deserted from latitude 60&#x00B0; 45&#x2032;; towards the south<lb break="yes"/>with Guayaquil, and (before 1786) with Val-<lb break="no"/>parairo, by the Rio San Juan; to the east with<lb break="yes"/>the province of Popayan, by the Tambo de<lb break="yes"/>Calima and by Cali. The ravine of the Raspa-<lb break="no"/>
                    <pb n="411" facs="#f0033"/>dura, which serves as a canal, and which I believe<lb break="yes"/>I was the first to make known in Europe, is<lb break="yes"/>often confounded on maps with the portage of<lb break="yes" />Calima and of San Pablo. The Arastradero de<lb break="yes"/>San <choice><sic>Publo</sic><corr type="editorial">Pablo</corr></choice> also leads to the Rio Quibdo, but<lb break="yes"/>several leagues above the mouth of the Raspa-<lb break="no"/>dura. It is by the road from this Arastradero of<lb break="yes"/>San Pablo that goods are generally sent from<lb break="yes" />Popayan by way of Cali, Tambo de Calima,<lb break="yes"/>and Novita to Choco del Norte, that is to say to<lb break="yes"/>Quibdo. It cannot be doubted that on any<lb break="yes"/>point of equinoctial <placeName key="amerika" >America</placeName>, whether in the<lb break="yes"/>isthmus of Choco, or those of Panama, Nicara-<lb break="no"/>gua, and Huasacualco, the union of two neigh-<lb break="no"/>bouring ports by a canal, from four to six feet<lb break="yes"/>deep, (Canal en petite section) or by a river<lb break="yes" />converted into a canal, would give rise to a very<lb break="yes"/>active commerce. This canal would act as a<lb break="yes"/>railway, and, however small, would animate and<lb break="yes"/>abridge the communications between the <placeName key="amerika">west-<lb break="no"/>ern American coast</placeName>s and the United States, and<lb break="yes"/>Europe: but however advisable enterprizes of<lb break="yes"/>this kind may be, they never can have that<lb break="yes"/>powerful influence on the commerce of the two<lb break="yes"/>hemispheres that a real oceanic canal would<lb break="yes" />have.</p>

                <p>VIII. In ten degrees south latitude, two or<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="412" facs="#f0034"/>three days&#x2019; journey from Lima, you come to the<lb break="yes"/>banks of the river Guallaga (or Huallaga) by<lb break="yes"/>which, without doubling Cape Horn, you may go<lb break="yes" />to the coasts of the Grand Para in Brazil. The<lb break="yes"/>sources of the Rio Huanuco, which falls into<lb break="yes"/>the Guallaga, are distant, near Chinche, four or<lb break="yes"/>five leagues from the sources of the Huaura,<lb break="yes"/>which empties itself into the Pacific. Even the<lb break="yes" />Rio Xauxa, which falls into the Apurimac or<lb break="yes"/>Ucayale, rises near Jauli, a short distance from<lb break="yes"/>the sources of the Rio Rimac, which traverses<lb break="yes"/>the city of Lima. The height of the Cordillera<lb break="yes"/>of Peru, and the nature of the ground, render the<lb break="yes"/>execution of a canal impossible; but the con-<lb break="no"/>struction of a convenient road from the capital<lb break="yes" />of Peru to the Rio Huanuco, would facilitate the<lb break="yes"/>conveyance of merchandize to Europe. The great<lb break="yes"/>rivers Ucayale and Guallaga, in five or six<lb break="yes"/>weeks, would bring the productions of Peru to the<lb break="yes"/>mouth of the <placeName key="amazonas">Amazons</placeName>, and to the coasts near-<lb break="no"/>est to Europe, whereas a voyage of four months<lb break="yes"/>is required to carry the same goods to the same<lb break="yes"/>point, if they double Cape Horn. The cultiva-<lb break="no" />tion of the beautiful regions on the eastern slope<lb break="yes"/>of the <placeName key="anden">Andes</placeName>, and the prosperity and riches<lb break="yes"/>of their inhabitants depend on a free naviga-<lb break="no" />tion of the river of the <placeName key="amazonas">Amazons</placeName>. This liberty,<lb break="yes"/>which the court of Portugal denied to the<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="413" facs="#f0035"/>Spaniards, might have been acquired in conse-<lb break="no"/>quence of the events preceding the peace of 1801.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>IX. Before the coast of Patagonia was suffi-<lb break="no"/>ciently explored, it was supposed that the gulph<lb break="yes"/>of Saint George, situated between 45&#x00B0; and 47&#x00B0; of<lb break="yes"/>south latitude, penetrated so far into the land as<lb break="yes"/>to communicate with the arms of the sea, which<lb break="yes"/>interrupt the continuity of the western coasts,<lb break="yes" />that is to say the coast opposite to the Archipe-<lb break="no"/>lago of Chayamapu. If this supposition were<lb break="yes"/>founded on a solid basis, vessels bound for<lb break="yes"/>the South Sea might cross <placeName key="suedamerika">South America</placeName>, 175<lb break="yes"/>leagues to the north of the straits of Magellan,<lb break="yes"/>and shorten their route above 700 leagues. Na-<lb break="no"/>vigators would by this means avoid the dangers<lb break="yes"/>which, notwithstanding the improvements in the<lb break="yes"/>science of navigation, still attend the voyage<lb break="yes" />round the Cape of Good Hope, and along the<lb break="yes"/>western coasts of Patagonia, from Cape Pilares<lb break="yes"/>to the parallel of the Chonos islands. In 1790<lb break="yes"/>these ideas had attracted the attention of the<lb break="yes"/>court of Madrid. Gil Lemos, viceroy of Peru,<lb break="yes"/>an upright and zealous governor, sent a small<lb break="yes" />expedition under Don Jose de Moraleda, to exa-<lb break="no"/>mine the southern coast of Chili. I have seen,<lb break="yes"/>in the instructions which he received at Lima,<lb break="yes"/>that he was enjoined to preserve the strictest<lb break="yes"/>secrecy, if he should be so fortunate as to discover<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="414" facs="#f0036"/>a communication between the two seas. Don<lb break="yes"/>Moraleda found in 1793 that the Estero of<lb break="yes" />Aysen, which had been visited in 1763 by the<lb break="yes"/>Jesuits, Fathers <persName key="garcia_j">Jose Garcia</persName> and Juan Vicu&#xf1;a,<lb break="yes"/>is of all the arms of the sea, that, by which the<lb break="yes"/>Pacific Ocean stretches the farthest to the east.<lb break="yes"/>This Estero however is not more than eight<lb break="yes" />leagues long, and terminates abruptly near the<lb break="yes"/>isle of la Cruz, where it receives, near a hot<lb break="yes"/>spring, a river of small depth. This Estero de<lb break="yes"/>Aysen, situated in 45&#x00B0; 28&#x2032; of Latitude, is there-<lb break="no"/>fore eighty-eight leagues distant from the gulph<lb break="yes"/>of Saint George. This last gulph was accurately<lb break="yes"/>surveyed by the expedition of <persName key="malaspina_a" >Malaspina</persName>. In<lb break="yes"/>1746 another communication had been suspected<lb break="yes"/>in Europe between the bay of St. Julien (latitude<lb break="yes"/>50&#x00B0; 53&#x2032;) and the Pacific Ocean.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>I have drawn upon one plate the nine points<lb break="yes"/>which seem to offer means of communication<lb break="yes"/>between the two seas, by uniting neighbouring<lb break="yes"/>rivers either by canals or by roads which could<lb break="yes"/>facilitate the conveyance of goods to places where<lb break="yes"/>the rivers become navigable. It is for the go-<lb break="no" />vernment, which possesses the most beautiful<lb break="yes"/>and fertile part of the globe, to perfect what I<lb break="yes"/>have only been able to hint at in this essay.<lb break="yes"/>Two Spanish engineers, Messrs. Le Maur have<lb break="yes"/>laid down with much care the plan of the canal<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="415" facs="#f0037"/>of Los Guines, which was intended to cross<lb break="yes"/>the whole isle of Cuba, from the <placeName key="batabano" >Batabano</placeName> to<lb break="yes"/>the Havannah. A similar survey made in the<lb break="yes"/>isthmus of Guasacualco, at lake Nicaragua, be-<lb break="no"/>tween Cruces and Panama, and between Cupica<lb break="yes"/>and the Rio Naipi<note place="foot" n="*">The information which Major Alvarez lately com-<lb break="no"/>municated to Captain Cochrane, is not favourable to<lb break="yes"/>the utility of a canal between the Rio Naixo or Naipi,<lb break="yes"/>(which flows into the <placeName key="atrato" >Atrato</placeName>) and the bay of Cupica or<lb break="yes"/>Tupica. This traveller assures us that the Naipipi is<lb break="yes"/>full of bars, and that the isthmus between the river and<lb break="yes"/>the coasts of the Pacific, is traversed by three ranges of<lb break="yes"/>hills. (Vide, Captain Cochrane&#x2019;s travels in Columbia.)</note> would direct the statesman<lb break="yes"/>in his choice: he would learn whether it is in<lb break="yes"/>Mexico, in Nicaragua, or in Darien, that this<lb break="yes" />grand enterprise should be executed, which<lb break="yes"/>would immortalize a government which should<lb break="yes"/>turn its attention to the true interests of hu-<lb break="no"/>manity.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The long voyage round <placeName key="suedamerika">South America</placeName>
                    <lb break="yes"/>would then become less frequent; a road would<lb break="yes" />be opened, if not for ships, at least for merchan-<lb break="no"/>dize, which might go from the <placeName key="atlantik">Atlantic</placeName> to the<lb break="yes"/>Pacific Ocean.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>When a canal shall unite the two oceans, the<lb break="yes"/>productions of Nootka Sound and China, will be<lb break="yes"/>brought above two thousand leagues nearer to<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="416" facs="#f0038"/>Europe and the United States. Then, and not<lb break="yes"/>before, great changes will be effected in the poli-<lb break="no"/>tical state of <placeName key="ostasien">Eastern Asia</placeName>; for this tongue of<lb break="yes"/>land, against which the waves of the <placeName key="atlantik">Atlantic</placeName>
                    <lb break="yes"/>break, has been for ages the bulwark of the<lb break="yes" />independence of China and Japan.</p>
