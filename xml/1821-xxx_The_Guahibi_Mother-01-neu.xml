            <p xml:lang="eng">M. Humboldt, in the account of his travels in South<lb break="yes"
                />America, relates a most affecting story: where the Atabapo<lb break="yes"/>enters
                the Rio Temi, the narrative says, &#x201C;Before we reached<lb break="yes"/>its
                confluence, a granitic hummock, that rises on the western<lb break="yes"/>bank, near
                the mouth of the Guasacavi, fixed our attention;<lb break="yes"/>it is called the
                    <hi rendition="#i">Rock of the Guahiba woman,</hi> or the Rock of the<lb
                    break="yes"/>Mother, <hi rendition="#i">Piedra de la Madre.</hi> We inquired the
                cause of so sin-<lb break="no"/>gular a denomination. Father Zea could not satisfy
                our cu-<lb break="no"/>riosity; but some weeks after, another missionary, one of
                    the<lb break="yes"/>predecessors of this ecclesisastic, whom we found settled
                    at<lb break="yes"/>San Fernando as president of the missions, related to us
                    an<lb break="yes"/>event, which I recorded in my journal, and which excited
                    in<lb break="yes"/>our minds the most painful feelings. If, in these solitary
                    scenes,<lb break="yes"/>man scarcely leaves behind him any trace of his
                existence, it is<lb break="yes"/>doubly humiliating for an European to see
                perpetuated by the<lb break="yes"/>name of a rock, by one of those imperishable
                monuments of<lb break="yes"/>nature, the remembrance of the moral degradation of our
                    spe-<lb break="no"/>cies, and the contrast between the virtue of a savage, and
                    the<lb break="yes"/>barbarism of <choice>
                    <sic>sivilized</sic>
                    <corr type="editorial">civilized</corr>
                </choice> man! In 1797, the missionary of San<lb break="yes"/>Fernando had led his
                Indians to the banks of the Rio Guaviare,<lb break="yes"/>on one of those hostile
                incursions, which are prohibited alike<lb break="yes"/>by religion and the Spanish
                laws. They found, in an Indian<lb break="yes"/>hut, a Guahiba mother with three
                children, two of whom were<lb break="yes"/>still infants: she was occupied in
                preparing the flour of<lb break="yes"/>Cassava. Resistance was impossible; the
                father was gone<lb break="yes"/>to fish, and the mother tried in vain to flee with
                her children.<lb break="yes"/>Scarcely had she reached the savannah, when she was
                    seized<lb break="yes"/>by the Indians of the mission, who go to hunt men, like
                    the<lb break="yes"/>whites and the negroes in Africa. The mother and her
                    chil-<lb break="no"/>dren were bound, and dragged to the bank of the river.
                    The<lb break="yes"/>monk, seated in his boat, waited the issue of an expedition,
                    of<lb break="yes"/>which he partook not the danger. Had the mother made too<lb
                    break="yes"/>violent a resistance, the Indians would have killed her, for<lb
                    break="yes"/>every thing is permitted when they go to the conquest of souls<lb
                    break="yes"/>(<hi rendition="#i">à la conquista espiritual,)</hi> and it is
                children in particular they<lb break="yes"/>seek to capture, in order to treat them,
                in the mission, as <hi rendition="#i">poitos</hi>
                <lb break="yes"/>or slaves of the Christians. The prisoners were carried to San<lb
                    break="yes"/>Fernando, in the hope that the mother would be unable to find<lb
                    break="yes"/>her way back to her home by land. Far from those children<lb
                    break="yes"/>who had accompanied their father on the day in which she<lb
                    break="yes"/>had been carried off, this unhappy woman showed signs of the<lb
                    break="yes"/>deepest despair. She attempted to take back to her family<lb
                    break="yes"/>the children who had been snatched away by the missionary,<lb
                    break="yes"/>and fled with them repeatedly from the village of San Fer-<lb
                    break="no"/>nando, but the Indians never failed to seize her anew; and<lb
                    break="yes"/>the missionary, after having caused her to be mercilessly<lb
                    break="yes"/>beaten, took the cruel resolution of separating the mother<lb
                    break="yes"/>from the two children who had been carried off with her. She<lb
                    break="yes"/>was conveyed alone toward the missions of the Rio Negro,<lb
                    break="yes"/>going up the Atabapo. Slightly bound, she was seated at the<lb
                    break="yes"/>bow of the boat, ignorant of the fate that awaited her; but<lb
                    break="yes"/>she judged, by the direction of the sun, that she was removed<lb
                    break="yes"/>farther and farther from her hut and her native country. She<lb
                    break="yes"/>succeeded in breaking her bonds, threw herself into the water,<lb
                    break="yes"/>and swam to the left bank of the Atabapo. The current car-<lb
                    break="no"/>ried her to a shelf of rock, which bears her name to this day.<lb
                    break="yes"/>She landed, and took shelter in the woods, but the president<lb
                    break="yes"/>of the missions ordered the Indians to row to the shore, and<lb
                    break="yes"/>follow the traces of the Guahiba. In the evening she was<lb
                    break="yes"/>brought back. Stretched upon the rock (<hi rendition="#i">la Piedra
                    de la Ma-<lb break="no"/>dre</hi>) a cruel punishment was inflicted on her with
                those straps<lb break="yes"/>of manatee leather, which serve for whips in that
                country, and<lb break="yes"/>with which the alcades are always furnished. This
                    unhappy<lb break="yes"/>woman, her hands tied behind her back with strong stalks
                    of<lb break="yes"/>
                <hi rendition="#i">mavacure,</hi> was then dragged to the mission of Javita. She
                    was<lb break="yes"/>there thrown into one of the caravanseras that are called
                    <hi rendition="#i">Casa<lb break="yes"/>del Rey.</hi> It was the rainy season,
                and the night was profoundly<lb break="yes"/>dark. Forests, till then believed to be
                impenetrable, sepa-<lb break="no"/>rated the mission of Javita from that of San
                Fernando, which<lb break="yes"/>was twenty-five leagues distant in a straight line.
                No other<lb break="yes"/>part is known than that of the rivers; no man ever
                    attempted<lb break="yes"/>to go by land from one
                        <choice><sic>villiage</sic><corr type="editorial">village</corr></choice> to
                another, were they only a<lb break="yes"/>few leagues apart. But such difficulties
                do not stop a mother,<lb break="yes"/>who is separated from her children. Her
                children are at San<lb break="yes"/>Fernando de Atabapo; she must find them again,
                she must<lb break="yes"/>execute her project of delivering them from the hands of
                    Chris-<lb break="no"/>tians, of bringing them back to their father on the banks
                of the<lb break="yes"/>Guaviare. The Guahiba was carelessly guarded in the cara-<lb
                    break="no"/>vansera. Her arms being wounded, the Indians of Javita had<lb
                    break="yes"/>loosened her bonds, unknown to the missionary and the al-<lb
                    break="no"/>cades. She succeeded by the help of her teeth in breaking<lb
                    break="yes"/>them entirely; disappeared during the night; and at the fourth<lb
                    break="yes"/>rising sun was seen at the mission of San Fernando, hovering<lb
                    break="yes"/>around the hut where her children were confined. &#x2018;What
                    that<lb break="yes"/>woman performed,&#x2019; added the missionary who gave us
                this sad<lb break="yes"/>narrative, &#x2018;the most robust Indian would not have
                ventured to<lb break="yes"/>undertake. She traversed the woods at a season when the
                    sky<lb break="yes"/>is constantly covered with clouds, and the sun during
                    whole<lb break="yes"/>days appears but for a few minutes. Did the course of
                    the<lb break="yes"/>waters direct her way? The inundations of the rivers
                    forced<lb break="yes"/>her to go far from the banks of the main stream, through
                    the<lb break="yes"/>midst of woods where the movement of the waters is almost<lb
                    break="yes"/>imperceptible. How often must she have been stopped by<lb
                    break="yes"/>the thorny lianas, that form a network around the trunks they<lb
                    break="yes"/>entwine! How often must she have swum across the rivulets,<lb
                    break="yes"/>that run into the Atabapo! This unfortunate woman was<lb
                    break="yes"/>asked how she had sustained herself during the four days? She<lb
                    break="yes"/>said, that, exhausted with fatigue, she could find no other nou-<lb
                    break="no"/>rishment than those great black ants, called <hi rendition="#i"
                    >vachacos,</hi> which<lb break="yes"/>climb the trees in long bands to suspend
                on them their resi-<lb break="no"/>nous nests.&#x2019; We pressed the missionary to
                tell us, whether the<lb break="yes"/>Guahiba had peacefully enjoyed the happiness of
                    remaining<lb break="yes"/>with her children; and if any repentance had followed
                    this<lb break="yes"/>excess of cruelty. He would not satisfy our curiosity;
                    but<lb break="yes"/>at our return from the Rio Negro we learnt, that the
                    Indian<lb break="yes"/>mother was not allowed time to cure her wounds, but
                    was<lb break="yes"/>again separated from her children, and sent to one of the
                    mis-<lb break="no"/>sions of the Upper Oroonoko. There she died, refusing all<lb
                    break="yes"/>kind of nourishment, as the savages do in great calamities.</p>
            <lb break="yes"/>
            <p>&#x201C;Such is the remembrance annexed to this fatal rock,<lb break="yes"/>
                <hi rendition="#i">Piedra de la Madre.</hi>&#x201D;</p>
