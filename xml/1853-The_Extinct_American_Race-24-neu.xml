<div n="1"><head><hi rendition="#i">An Extinct American Race.</hi></head><p>&#x2014;The following<lb/>passage from the Travels of Humboldt, possesses<lb/>more than ordinary interest at the present time:</p><lb/><p>&#x201C;Amidst the plains of North America, some<lb/>powerful nation, which has disappeared,
                    con-<lb/>structed circular, square, and octagonal fortifica-<lb/>tions; walls,
                    6000 toises in length; tumuli, from<lb/>700 to 800 feet in diameter, and 140
                    feet in<lb/>height, sometimes round, sometimes with several<lb/>stories, and,
                    containing thousands of skeletons.<lb/>These skeletons are the remains of men
                    less<lb/>slender and more squat than the present inhabit-<lb/>ants of those
                    countries. On a vast space of<lb/>ground at the Lower Orinoco, as well as on
                    the<lb/>banks of the Casiquiare, and between the sources<lb/>of the Essequibo
                    and the Rio Branco, there are<lb/>rocks of granite covered with symbolic
                    figures.<lb/>These sepulchres denote that the extinct genera-<lb/>tions belonged
                    to nations different from those<lb/>which now inhabit the same region.</p></div><lb/></body><back></back>
