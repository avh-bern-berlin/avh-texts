The importance of the<lb/>undertaking is fully admitted by the learned baron;<lb/>and he urges the necessity of constructing a canal<lb/>without locks as the only medium of communication<lb/>suitable for the accommodation of the trade of the<lb/>world. It is now said that it was to the absence of this<lb/>important feature in the Nicaragua ship-canal-scheme<lb/>that the failure of that project was mainly owing:&#x2014;</p><lb/><dateline><hi rendition="#et">&#x201C;Potsdam, June 4, 1853.</hi></dateline><lb/>

    <p>&#x201C;Sir&#x2014;I am very much to blame for having so long<lb/>delayed an answer to the agreeable and interesting<lb/>dispatch that you have been kind enough to forward<lb/>me, by the hands of Mr. Augustus Peterman, so<lb/>estimable by his character as well as by the solidity of<lb/>his geographical labours. Dr. Cullen cannot doubt the<lb/>high importance that I would attach to the merit of his<lb/>courageous and useful investigations in the eastern<lb/>part of the Isthmus of Panama. Knowing my position<lb/>and my antediluvian age, he will receive with indul-<lb/>gence, even so late, the expression of my lively<lb/>gratitude.</p><lb/><p>&#x201C;After having laboured in vain, during half a century,<lb/>to prove the possibility of an oceanic canal, and to<lb/>point out the Gulf of San Miguel and Cupica as the<lb/>points most worthy of attention&#x2014;after having regretted,<lb/>almost with bitterness, in the last edition of my<lb/>&#x2018;Aspects of Nature,&#x2019; that the employment of the means<lb/>which the present state of our knowledge affords for<lb/>obtaining precise measurements has been so long<lb/>delayed, I ought, more than any one else, to be satisfied<lb/>to see, at last, my hopes for so noble an enterprise<lb/>revived. By your publications, and by that of Mr.<lb/>Gisborne, will be originated the great work of changing<lb/>an important part of the commerce of nations, and of<lb/>rendering more accessible the rich countries of Eastern<lb/>Asia and the Indian Archipelago. The undertaking is<lb/>by no means above the intellectual and material power<lb/>which civilised nations have attained to. The work<lb/>should be one to last for ever&#x2014;it should not commence<lb/>with a canal with locks like the magnificent Caledonian<lb/>Canal&#x2014;it must be a really oceanic canal without locks<lb/>&#x2014;a free passage from sea to sea, across which the speed<lb/>of the navigation will be modified, but not interrupted,<lb/>by the difference in height and non-coincidence of the<lb/>tides.</p><closer><salute><hi rendition="#et">Receive the expression of my highest considera-<lb/>tion.
