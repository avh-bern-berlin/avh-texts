    <p>Baron de Humboldt has addressed the following<lb/>
        note to the Berlin journals:&#x2014;&#x201C;Overwhelmed by<lb/>
        the number of letters sent me, and which are<lb/>
        increasing every day, amounting to from 1,600 to<lb/>
        2,000 per annum; many, too, being on the most<lb/>
        futile subjects, such as demands for my autograph,<lb/>
        and offers to cure me of all diseases; I once more<lb/>
        make a public appeal to the persons who wish me<lb/>
        well, and request them not to occupy themselves<lb/>
        so much with what concerns me, in order that with<lb/>
        the diminution of strength, physical and intel-<lb/>
        lectual, which I experience, I may be allowed a<lb/>
        little leisure for study and composition. I trust<lb/>
        that this step, to which I have recourse with re-<lb/>
        luctance, will not be interpreted unkindly.&#x201D;</p></body><back></back>
