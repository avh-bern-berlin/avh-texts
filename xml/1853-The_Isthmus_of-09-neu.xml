<p>Dr. Cullen&#x2019;s plan for crossing the Isthmus of<lb/>Panama by a Ship Canal has received the
                emphatic<lb/>testimony in its favour of the veteran Alexander<lb/>Von Humboldt.
                &#x2014; &#x201C;After having,&#x201D; he says,<lb/>&#x201C;laboured, in vain,
                during half a century, to prove<lb/>the possibility of an <hi rendition="#i">Oceanic
                    Canal</hi>, and to point<lb/>out the Gulf of San Miguel and Cupica as
                the<lb/>points most worthy of attention,&#x2014;after having re-<lb/>gretted, almost
                with bitterness, in the last edition<lb/>of my &#x2018;Aspects of Nature,&#x2019;
                that the employment<lb/>of the means which the present state of our know-<lb/>ledge
                affords for obtaining precise measurements<lb/>has been so long delayed,&#x2014;I
                ought, more than any<lb/>one else, to be satisfied to see, at last, my hopes<lb/>for
                so noble an enterprise revived. ** The under-<lb/>taking is by no means above the
                intellectual and<lb/>material power which civilized nations have attained<lb/>to.
                The work should be one to last for ever. It<lb/>should not commence with a canal
                with locks, like<lb/>the magnificent Caledonian Canal; it must be a<lb/>really <hi
                    rendition="#i">Oceanic</hi> Canal, without locks, &#x2014; a free
                passage<lb/>from sea to sea, across which the speed of the navi-<lb/>gation will be
                modified, but not interrupted, by the<lb/>difference in height and non-coincidence
                of the<lb/>tides.&#x201D;</p><lb/></body><back></back>
