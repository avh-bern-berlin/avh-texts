    <div n="1"><head>ON THE KNOWN THICKNESS OF THE CRUST<lb/>OF THE EARTH.</head><lb/><p><hi rendition="#k">It</hi> is proper to distinguish between the <hi rendition="#i">absolute</hi><lb/>depth to which man has penetrated in his mining<lb/>operations, or the depth from the surface of the<lb/>earth at the place where the operations are carried<lb/>on, and the <hi rendition="#i">relative</hi> depth, <hi rendition="#i">i. e.,</hi> the depth below<lb/>the level of the sea. The greatest relative depth<lb/>that has been reached is, perhaps, the bore at Mew<lb/>Salzwerk, Minden, in Prussia. In June, 1844, it<lb/>was exactly 1844&#x0BD; Parisian feet; the absolute<lb/>depth was, however, 2094&#x0BD; Par. feet. The tem-<lb/>perature of the water in the deepest bore was<lb/>32&#x00B7;7° C. (90&#x00B7;8° F.) which assuming 9&#x00B7;6° C. as<lb/>the mean temperature of the air, gives a rise of<lb/>1&#x00B7;6° for 29&#x00B7;6 metres (upwards of 97&#x00B7;6 feet Eng-<lb/>lish.) The Artesian well of Grenelle, at Paris, is<lb/>only 1683 feet in absolute depth. From the ac-<lb/>counts of the missionary Imbert from China, the<lb/>depth of our Artesian wells is far surpassed by<lb/>that of the fire-spring, Ho-tsing, which yields<lb/>inflammable gas, employed in salt boiling. In the<lb/>Chinese province Szü-tschuan, these fire-springs<lb/>are said very commonly to reach a depth of from<lb/><pb n="259" facs="#f0002" />

        1800 to 2000 feet; and at Tseu-lieu-tsing (place<lb/>of perpetual flux) a Ho-tsing bored with the rod in<lb/>the year 1812, is reported to extend to the depth<lb/>of 3000 feet (Humboldt, Asie Centrale, t. ii., p.<lb/>521 and 525; Annales de l&#x2019;Association de la Pro-<lb/>pagation de la Foi, 1829, No. 16, p. 369.) The<lb/>relative depth attained at Monte Massi, in Tus-<lb/>cany, south from Volterra, according to Matteucci,<lb/>is about 1175 feet. The bore at New Salzwerk<lb/>approaches very nearly in relative depth the coal<lb/>pit at Apendale, Newcastle-under-Lyme (Staf-<lb/>fordshire.) There the works are carried on 725<lb/>yards, or 2045 French feet, under the surface.<lb/>(Th. Smith, The Miner&#x2019;s Guide, 1836, p. 160.)<lb/>Unfortunately, the height of the ground above the<lb/>level of the sea is not accurately ascertained. The<lb/>relative depth of the Monkwearmouth pit, near<lb/>Newcastle-on-Tyne, is only 1404 feet (Philips,<lb/>Philos. Mag., vol. v., 1834, p. 446;) that of the<lb/>Esperance pit, at Liege, 1271; and that of the<lb/>lately-worked pit Marihaye, at Val St. Lambert, is<lb/>1127 feet. The greatest absolute depths to which<lb/>man has penetrated are in mines that are either<lb/>among lofty mountains or in mountain-valleys, so<lb/>much raised above the sea level, that this has<lb/>either not been reached at all, or has only been<lb/>surpassed by a very small quantity.</p><lb/><p>The Eselschacht at Kuttenberg, Bohemia,<lb/>before it was abandoned, had reached the enor-<lb/>mous depth of 3545 feet (Schmidt, Berggesetze,<lb/>Bd. 1. S. 32.) At St. Daniel, and at Geist, on<lb/>the Röhrerbühel, the works, in the 16th century,<lb/>were 2916 feet deep. A drawing of these work-<lb/>ings of the year 1539 is still preserved. (Joseph<lb/>Von Sperges, Tyroler Bergwerks-Geschichte, S.<lb/>121. See also Humboldt, Gutachten über Heran-<lb/>treibung des Meissner Stollens in die Freiberger<lb/>Erzrevier, published in Herder über den jetzt<lb/>begonnenen Erbstollen, 1838, S. 124.) It may<lb/>be imagined that information of the extraordinary<lb/>depth of the workings at Röhrerbühel had reached<lb/>England at an early period, for in Gilbert&#x2019;s work,<lb/>De Magnete, I find the statement that man had<lb/>penetrated from 2400 to 3000 feet into the bowels<lb/>of the earth.</p><lb/><p>The absolute depth of the mines in the Saxon<lb/>Erzgebirge are 1824 and 1714 feet; the relative<lb/>depths of these respectively are only 626 and 260.<lb/>The absolute depth of the rich workings in Joa-<lb/>chimsthal, Bohemia, is 1919 feet; but taking the<lb/>height of the surface upon Dechen&#x2019;s estimate at<lb/>2250 feet above the level of the sea, it is obvious<lb/>that there the sea level has not even been attained.<lb/>In the Harz, the workings in the Samson pit, at<lb/>Andreasberg, are carried on at the absolute depth<lb/>of 2062 feet. In Old Spanish America, I know<lb/>of no deeper mines than those of Valenciana, near<lb/>Guanaxuato, Mexico; I found the Planes de San<lb/>Bernard 1582 feet deep; but this mine does not<lb/>reach the level of the sea by 5592 feet. If we<lb/>compare the depth of the old Kuttenberg works<lb/>(a depth which exceeds the height of the Brocken,<lb/>and only falls short of that of Etna by 200 feet)<lb/>with the heights of the loftiest buildings that have<lb/>been reared by man (the Pyramid of Cheops and<lb/>the Minster at Strasburg,) we find that the mines<lb/>are to these in proportion of 3 to 1.</p><lb/><p>Basin-shaped curved strata, which dip down on<lb/>one hand and rise at a measureable distance,<lb/>although not penetrated by mines or shafts, still<lb/>suffice to give us accurate information of the con-<lb/>stitution of the crust of the earth at great depths<lb/>from the surface. I have to thank the excellent<lb/><cb/>
            geologist M. Von Dechen for the following:&#x2014;He<lb/>writes to me. &#x201C;The depth of the coal measures at<lb/>Mont St. Gilles, Liege, which our friend M. Von<lb/>Oeynhausen has estimated at 3650 feet below the<lb/>surface, must lie at the depth of 3250 feet below<lb/>the sea level, inasmuch as Mont St. Gilles is cer-<lb/>tainly not 400 feet high; and the coal basin at<lb/>Mons lies fully 1750 feet deeper. These depres-<lb/>sions, however, are trifling when compared with<lb/>that of the coal strata of the Saar-Revier (Saar-<lb/>brücken). After repeated trials, have found that<lb/>the lowest coal strata known in the country of<lb/>Duttweiler near Bettingen, north-eastward from<lb/>Saarlouis, dip 19,406, and 20,656 feet under the<lb/>level of the sea.&#x201D; This conclusion exceeds by<lb/>8000 feet the estimate which I have given in the<lb/>text of Cosmos for the basin of Devonian strata.<lb/>These Belgian coal measures, therefore, lie as far<lb/>below the level of the sea as Chimborazo rises<lb/>above it, at a depth where the temperature of the<lb/>earth must be 224° C. (435° F.) From the<lb/>highest summit of the Himalaya to the bottom of<lb/>this basin, containing vegetable remains of the<lb/>primeval world, we have a perpendicular depth of<lb/>45,000 feet, <hi rendition="#i">i. e.,</hi> <formula notation="TeX">\left( \frac{1}{435} \right)</formula> of the semi-diameter of the<lb/>earth.</p><lb/><p>I have thought it important thus to bring together<lb/>these data in relation to the absolute and relative<lb/>depths that have been reached by man, a subject in<lb/>connection with which many errors have been<lb/>constantly committed, principally, as it seems,<lb/>through faulty reductions of the measurements<lb/>from one standard to another. On proceeding<lb/>eastward from Jerusalem toward the Dead Sea, a<lb/>prospect is gained which, according to our present<lb/>hypsometrical knowledge, is unparalleled on the<lb/>face of the earth. There, on approaching the<lb/>chasm in which the Jordan flows, we advance,<lb/>in open day, along beds of rock, which, accord-<lb/>ing to Bertou&#x2019;s and Russegger&#x2019;s barometrical<lb/>levellings, lie 1300 feet in perpendicular depth<lb/>below the level of the Mediterranean Sea.
