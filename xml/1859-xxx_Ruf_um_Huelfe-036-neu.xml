    <p><hi rendition="#k">Baron de Humboldt</hi> has addressed the following<lb/>
        note to the Berlin journals:&#x2014;&#x201C;Overwhelmed by the number of<lb/>
        letters sent me, which are increasing every day, amounting to from<lb/>
        1600 to 2000 per annum; many, too, being on the most futile<lb/>
        subjects, such as demands for my autograph, and offers to cure me<lb/>
        of all diseases; I once more make a public appeal to the persons<lb/>
        who wish me well, and request them not to occupy themselves so<lb/>
        much with what concerns me, in order that with the diminution<lb/>
        of strength, physical and intellectual, which I experience, I may<lb/>
        be allowed a little leisure for study and composition. I trust that<lb/>
        this step, to which I have recourse with reluctance, will not be<lb/>
        interpreted unkindly.&#x201D;</p></body><back></back>
