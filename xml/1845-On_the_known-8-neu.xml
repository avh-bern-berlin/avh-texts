<div n="1"><head><hi rendition="#k">Depth of Coal and other Mines.</hi></head><p>&#x2014;In speaking of the greatest<lb/>depths within the earth reached by human labour, we must recollect that<lb/>there is a difference between the <hi rendition="#i">absolute</hi> depth (that is the depth below<lb/>the earth&#x2019;s surface at that point) and the <hi rendition="#i">relative</hi> depth (or that beneath<lb/>the level of the sea). The greatest relative depth that man has hitherto<lb/>reached, is probably the bore at the new salt-works at Minden, in Prussia.<lb/>In June, 1844, it was exactly 1,993 feet, the absolute depth being 2,231 feet.<lb/>The temperature of the water at the bottom was 91° Fahr., which, assuming<lb/>the mean temperature of the air at 49&#x00B7;3, gives an augmentation of tem-<lb/>perature of a degree for every 54 feet. [At this rate of increase of heat, a<lb/><pb n="330" facs="#f0002" />
    stratum of granite would be in a state of fusion at a depth of nearly twenty-<lb break="maybe"/>one geographical miles, or between four and five times the elevation of the<lb/>highest summit of the Himalaya.] The absolute depth of the Artesian<lb/>well of Grenelle, near Paris, is only 1,795 feet. The wells sunk by the<lb/>Chinese, for the purpose of obtaining carburetted hydrogen gas for salt-<lb break="maybe"/>boiling, commonly exceed 2,000 feet, whilst one is said to be of the depth<lb/>of 3,197 feet. The relative depth reached at Mount Massi, in Tuscany,<lb/>south of Volterra, amounts to only 1,253 feet. The boring at the new salt-<lb break="maybe"/>works at Minden is probably of about the same relative depth as the coal-<lb break="maybe"/>mine at Apendale, near Newcastle-under-Lyne, where men work 2,175<lb/>feet below the surface of the earth. Unfortunately, I do not know the<lb/>exact height of its mouth above the level of the sea. The relative depth of<lb/>the Monkwearmouth mine (Sunderland) is only 1,496 feet. That of the<lb/>Liege coal-mine, <hi rendition="#i">L&#x2019;Espérance</hi>, at Seraing, is 1,355 feet; and the old mine<lb/>of Marihaye, in the valley of the Maes, is 1,233 feet in depth. The works<lb/>of greatest absolute depth that have ever been formed, are for the most<lb/>part situated in such elevated plains or valleys that they either do not<lb/>descend so low as the level of the sea, or, at most, reach very little below<lb/>it. Thus at Eselschacht, in Bohemia, a mine, which cannot now be worked,<lb/>had the enormous absolute depth of 3,778 feet; also, at St. Daniel, and at<lb/>Geish, on the Rörerbühel, there were, in the sixteenth century, excavations<lb/>of 3,107 feet&#x2014;the plans of the works being still preserved. The absolute<lb/>depth of the mines in the Saxon Erzgebirge, near Frieburg, are, in the<lb/>Thurmofer Mine, 1,944 feet; in the Honenbirker Mines, 1,827 feet; the<lb/>relative depths being, however, only 677 and 277 feet. The absolute depth<lb/>of the celebrated mine of Joachimstal, in Bohemia, is full 2,120 feet. In the<lb/>Harz the Samson Mine, at Andreasberg, has an absolute depth of 2,197 feet.<lb/>In what was formerly Spanish America, I know of no mine deeper than the<lb/>Valenciana (Mexico), where I found the absolute depth of the Planes de<lb/>San Bernando to be 1,686 feet; but these planes are 5,960 feet above the<lb/>level of the sea. If we compare the depth of the old Kultenburger Mine<lb/>(a depth greater than the height of the Brocken, and only 200 feet less than<lb/>that of Vesuvius) with the loftiest structures that the hands of man have<lb/>erected (with the pyramid of Cheops, and with the cathedral of Strasburg),<lb/>we find that they stand in the ratio of eight to one. In this notice I have<lb/>collected all the certain information I could find regarding the greatest<lb/>absolute and relative depths of mines and borings. In descending east-<lb/>ward from Jerusalem towards the Dead Sea, a view presents itself to the<lb/>eye which, according to our present hypsometrical knowledge of the surface<lb/>of our planet, is unrivalled in any country. As we approach the open<lb/>ravine through which the Jordan takes its course, we tread, with the open<lb/>skies above us, on rocks which, according to the barometric measurements<lb/>of Berton and Russegger, are 1,385 feet below the level of the Mediterranean.</p></div><lb/></body><back></back>
