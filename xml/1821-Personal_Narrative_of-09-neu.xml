                    that the natives, seized with dismay,<lb break="yes"/>burn their huts, kill

                        break="no"/>tian settlements is, the repugnance of the<lb break="yes"
                    />Indians for the regulations of the missions,<lb break="yes"/>the insalubrity
                    of a climate at once hot and<lb break="yes"/>damp, bad nourishment, want of care
                    in the<lb break="yes"/>diseases of children, and the guilty prac-<lb break="no"
                    />tice of mothers of preventing pregnancy<lb break="yes"/>by the use of
                    deleterious herbs. Among<lb break="yes"/>the barbarous people of Guyana, as well
                        as<lb break="yes"/>those of the half-civilized islands of the<lb break="yes"
                    />South Sea, young wives will not become<lb break="yes"/>mothers. If they have
                    children, their off-<lb break="no"/>spring are exposed, not only to the
                        dangers<lb break="yes"/>of savage life, but also to the dangers ari-<lb

                    twins are born, false notions of pro-<lb break="no"/>priety and family honor
                    require, that one of<lb break="yes"/>them should be destroyed. &#x2018;To bring
                        twins<lb break="yes"/>into the world, is to be exposed to public<lb
                        break="yes"/>scorn; it is to resemble rats, opossums, and<lb break="yes"
                    />the vilest animals, which bring forth a great<lb break="yes"/>number of young
                    at a time.&#x2019; Nay more:<lb break="yes"/>&#x2018;two children born at the
                    same time cannot<lb break="yes"/>belong to the same father.&#x2019; This is an
                        ax-<lb break="no"/>iom of physiology of the Salivas; and in ev-<lb
                        break="no"/>ery zone, and in different states of society,<lb break="yes"

                    more stedfastness than the<lb break="yes"/>better informed men, by whom it was
                        first<lb break="yes"/>hazarded. To avoid a disturbance of conju-<lb
                        break="no"/>gal tranquillity, the old female relations of<lb break="yes"

                        break="no"/>wives,] take care, that one of the twins shall<lb break="yes"
                    />disappear. If the new-born infant, though<lb break="yes"/>not a twin, have any
                    physical deformity, the<lb break="yes"/>father instantly puts it to death. They

                        break="yes"/>what is become of one of his sons, he will<lb break="yes"
                    />pretend that he has lost him by a natural<lb break="yes"/>death. He will
                    disavow an action, that ap-<lb break="no"/>pears to him blameable, but not
                    criminal.</p>

                        nature</hi>! He kills his<lb break="yes"/>son, to escape the ridicule of
                    having twins,<lb break="yes"/>or, to avoid journeying more slowly; in fact,<lb
                        break="yes"/>to avoid a little inconvenience.&#x201D;</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>&#x201C;The Indians of Atures,&#x201D; [says Mr. H.,]<lb break="yes"/>are mild,
                    moderate, and accustomed, from<lb break="yes"/>the effects of their idleness, to
                    the greatest<lb break="yes"/>privations. Formerly, excited to labour by<lb
                        break="yes"/>the Jesuits, they did not want for food. The<lb break="yes"
                    />fathers cultivated maize, French beans, (<hi rendition="#i">fri-<lb break="no"
                        />soles</hi>) and other European vegetables; they<lb break="yes"/>even
                    planted sweet oranges and tamarinds<lb break="yes"/>round the villages; and they
                    possessed twen-<lb break="no"/>ty or thirty thousand head of cows and hor-<lb
                        break="no"/>ses, in the savannahs of Atures and Carich-<lb break="no"/>ana.
                    They had at their service a great<lb break="yes"/>number of slaves and servants
                        [<hi rendition="#i">peones</hi>], to<lb break="yes"/>take care of their
                    herds. Nothing is now<lb break="yes"/>cultivated but a little cassava, and a
                        few<lb break="yes"/>plantains. The fertility of the soil however<lb
                        break="yes"/>is such, that at Atures I counted on a single<lb break="yes"
                    />branch of musa 108 fruits, 4 or 5 of which<lb break="yes"/>would almest
                    suffice for the daily nourish-<lb break="no"/>ment of a man. The culture of
                    maize is<lb break="yes"/>entirely neglected, and the horses and cows<lb
                        break="yes"/>have disappeared. Near the <hi rendition="#i">raudal</hi>, a
                        part<lb break="yes"/>of the village still bears the name of <hi
                        rendition="#i">passo<lb break="yes"/>del ganado</hi> (ford of the cattle)
                    while the de-<lb break="no"/>scendants of those very Indians, whom the<lb
                        break="yes"/>Jesuits had assembled in a mission, speak of<lb break="yes"
                    />horned cattle as of animals of a race that is<lb break="yes"/>lost. In going
                    up the Oronoko, toward San<lb break="yes"/>Carlos del Rio Negro, we saw the last
                        cow<lb break="yes"/>at Carichana. The fathers of the Obser-<lb break="no"
                    />vance, who now govern these vast coun-<lb break="no"/>tries, did not
                    immediately succeed the<lb break="yes"/>Jesuits. During an interregnum of
                        eigh-<lb break="no"/>teen years the missions were visited only<lb
                        break="yes"/>from time to time, and by Capuchin monks.<lb break="yes"/>The
                    agents of the secular government, un-<lb break="no"/>der the title of <hi
                        rendition="#i">Commissioners of the King</hi>,<lb break="yes"/>managed the
                        <hi rendition="#i">hatos</hi> or farms of the Jesuits<lb break="yes"/>with
                    culpable negligence. They killed the<lb break="yes"/>cattle is order to sell the
                    hides. Many<lb break="yes"/>heifers were devoured by tigers, and a<lb
                        break="yes"/>greater number perished in consequence of<lb break="yes"
                    />wounds made by the bats of the <hi rendition="#i">raudales</hi>,<lb
                        break="yes"/>which are much less, but far bolder than<lb break="yes"/>the
                    bats of the Llanos. At the time of the<lb break="yes"/>expedition of the

                        were<lb break="yes"/>conveyed as far as San Jose of Maravita-<lb break="no"
                    />nos, where, on the banks of the Rio Negro,<lb break="yes"/>the Portugueze
                    could only procure them af-<lb break="no"/>ter a long passage, and of a very
                        inferior<lb break="yes"/>quality, by the river Amazon and Grand<lb
                        break="yes"/>Para. Since the year 1795, the cattle of<lb break="yes"/>the
                    Jesuits have entirely disappeared.<lb break="yes"/>There now remains in
                    testimony of the an-<lb break="no"/>cient cultivation of these countries, and
                        the<lb break="yes"/>industrious activity of the first missionaries,<lb
                        break="yes"/>only a few trunks of the orange and tama-<lb break="no"/>rind
                    in the savannahs, surrounded by wild<lb break="yes"/>trees.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>&#x201C;The tigers, or jaguars, which are less<lb break="yes"/>dangerous for the cattle than the bats,<lb break="yes"/>come into the village at Atures, and devour<lb break="yes"/>the pigs of the poor Indians. The mission-<lb break="no"/>ary related to us a striking instance of the<lb break="yes" />familiarity of these animals, upon the whole<lb break="yes"/>so ferocious. Some months before our ar-<lb break="no"/>rival, a jaguar, which was thought to be<lb break="yes"/>young, though of a large size, had wounded<lb break="yes" />a child in playing with him; I use confi-<lb break="no"/>dently this expression, which may seem<lb break="yes"/>strange, having on the spot verified facts<lb break="yes"/>which are not without interest in the his-<lb break="no"/>tory of the manners of animals. Two In-<lb break="no"/>dian children, a boy and a girl, about eight<lb break="yes"/>and nine years of age, were seated on the<lb break="yes"/>grass near the village of Atures, in the mid-<lb break="no"/><cb/>dle of a savannah, which we have often<lb break="yes" />traversed. At two o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon,<lb break="yes"/>a jaguar issued from the forest, and ap-<lb break="no"/>proached the children, bounding around<lb break="yes"/>them; sometimes he hid himself in the high<lb break="yes"/>grass, sometimes he sprang forward, his<lb break="yes"/>back bent, his head hung down, in the man-<lb break="no"/>ner of our cats. The little boy, ignorant<lb break="yes"/>of his danger, seemed to be sensible of it<lb break="yes"/>only when the jaguar with one of his paws<lb break="yes"/>gave him some blows on the head. These<lb break="yes"/>blows, at first slight, became ruder and<lb break="yes"/>ruder; the claws of the jaguar wounded<lb break="yes" />the child, and the blood flowed with vio-<lb break="no"/>lence. The little girl then took a branch<lb break="yes"/>of a tree, struck the animal, and it fled<lb break="yes"/>from her. The Indians ran up at the cries<lb break="yes"/>of the children, and saw the jaguar, which<lb break="yes" />retired bounding, without the least show of<lb break="yes"/>resistance.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>&#x201C;The little boy was brought to us, who<lb break="yes"/>appeared lively and intelligent. The claw<lb break="yes"/>of the jaguar had taken away the skin from<lb break="yes"/>the lower part of the forehead, and there<lb break="yes"/>was a second scar at the top of the head.&#x201D;</p>

                <p>&#x201C;Among the monkies,&#x201D; the author con-<lb break="no"/>tinues,
                    &#x201C;which we saw at the mission of<lb break="yes"/>the Atures, we found one
                    new species, of<lb break="yes"/>the tribe of <hi rendition="#i">sais</hi> and
                        <hi rendition="#i">sajous</hi>, which the Cre-<lb break="no"/>oles vulgarly
                    call <hi rendition="#i">machis.</hi> It is the <hi rendition="#i">ouara-<lb
                            break="no"/>pavi</hi> with grey hair and a bluish face. It<lb
                        break="yes"/>has the orbits of the eyes and forehead as<lb break="yes"
                    />white as snow, which at first sight distin-<lb break="no"/>guishes it from the
                        <hi rendition="#i">simia capucina</hi>, the <hi rendition="#i">simia<lb
                            break="yes"/>apella</hi>, the <hi rendition="#i">simia trepida</hi>, and
                    the other<lb break="yes"/>weeping monkeys hitherto so confusedly<lb break="yes"
                    />described.&#x2014;This little animal is as gentle<lb break="yes"/>as it is
                    ugly.&#x2014;Every day in the court-yard<lb break="yes"/>of the missionary it
                    seized a pig, upon which<lb break="yes"/>it remained from morning till night,
                        tra-<lb break="no"/>versing the savannahs. We have also seen<lb break="yes"
                    />it upon the back of a large cat, which had<lb break="yes"/>been brought up
                    with it in father Zea&#x2019;s<lb break="yes"/>house.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>&#x201C;It was among the cataracts that we<lb break="yes"/>began to hear of the
                    hairy man of the<lb break="yes"/>woods, called salvaje, that carries off wo-<lb
                        break="no"/>men, constructs huts, and sometimes eats<lb break="yes"/>human
                    flesh. The Tamanacks call it <hi rendition="#i">achi</hi>,<lb break="yes"/>and
                    the Maypures <hi rendition="#i">vasitri</hi>, or <hi rendition="#i">great
                        devil.</hi>
                    <lb break="yes"/>The natives and the missionaries have no<lb break="yes"/>doubt
                    of the existence of this anthropomor-<lb break="no"/>phous monkey, which they
                    singularly dread.<lb break="yes"/>Father Gili gravely relates the history of
                        a<lb break="yes"/>lady in the town of San Carlos, who much<lb break="yes"
                    />praised the gentle character and attentions<lb break="yes"/>of the man of the
                    woods. She lived several<lb break="yes"/>years with one in great domestic
                        harmony,<lb break="yes"/>and only requested some hunters to take<lb
                        break="yes"/>her back &#x2018;because she was tired, she and<lb break="yes"
                    />her children, (a little hairy also,) of living<lb break="yes"/>far from the
                    church and the sacraments.&#x2019;<lb break="yes"/>The same author,
                    notwithstanding his cre-<lb break="no"/>dulity, confesses, that he had not been
                        able<lb break="yes"/>to find an Indian who asserted positively<lb
                        break="yes"/>that he had seen the <hi rendition="#i">salvaje</hi> with his
                        own<lb break="yes"/>eyes. This fable, which the missionaries,<lb break="yes"
                    />the European planters, and the negroes of<lb break="yes"/>Africa, have no
                    doubt embellished with ma-<lb break="no"/>ny features taken from the description
                        of<lb break="yes"/>the manners of the ourang outang, the gib-<lb break="no"
                    />bon, the jocko or chimpanzee, and the pon-<lb break="no"/>go, pursued us
                    during five years from the<lb break="yes"/>northern to the southern hemisphere;
                        and<lb break="yes"/>we were every where blamed, in the most<lb break="yes"
                    />cultivated class of society, for being the<lb break="yes"/>only persons to
                    doubt the existence of the<lb break="yes"/>great anthropomorphous monkey of
                        Ameri-<lb break="no"/>ca. We shall first observe, that there are<lb
                        break="yes"/>certain regions where this belief is particu-<lb break="no"
                    />larly prevalent among the people; such are<lb break="yes"/>the banks of the
                    Upper Oronoko, the val-<lb break="no"/>ley of Upar near the lake of
                        Maracaybo,<lb break="yes"/>the mountains of Santa Martha and of Me-<lb
                        break="no"/>rida, the provinces of Quixos, and the banks<lb break="yes"/>of
                    the Amazon near Tomependa. In all<lb break="yes"/>these places, so distant one
                    from the other,<lb break="yes"/>it is repeated, that the <hi rendition="#i"
                        >salvaje</hi> is easily re-<lb break="no"/>cognized by the traces of his
                    feet, the toes<lb break="yes"/>of which are turned backward. But if<lb
                        break="yes"/>there exist a monkey of a large size in the<lb break="yes"/>New
                    Continent, how has it happened that<lb break="yes"/>during three centuries no
                    man worthy of<lb break="yes"/>belief has been able to procure the skin of<lb
                        break="yes"/>one? Several hypotheses present them-<lb break="no"/>selves to
                    the mind in order to explain the<lb break="yes"/>source of so ancient an error
                    or belief. Has<lb break="yes"/>the famous <hi rendition="#i">capuchin</hi>
                    monkey of Esmeralda,<lb break="yes"/>the canine teeth of which are more than<lb
                        break="yes"/>six lines and a half long, the physiognomy<lb break="yes"/>much
                    more like man&#x2019;s than that of the ou-<lb break="no"/>rang outang, and
                    which, when irritated,<lb break="yes"/>rubs its beard with its hand, given rise
                        to<lb break="yes"/>the fable of the <hi rendition="#i">salvaje?</hi> It is
                    not so large<lb break="yes"/>indeed as the coaita (<hi rendition="#i">simia
                        paniscus</hi>,) but<lb break="yes"/>when seen at the top of a tree, and
                        the<lb break="yes"/>head only visible, it might easily be taken<lb
                        break="yes"/>for a human being. It may be also (and<lb break="yes"/>this
                    opinion appears to me the most proba-<lb break="no"/>ble) that the man of the
                    woods was one of<lb break="yes"/>those large bears, the footsteps of which<lb
                        break="yes"/>resemble those of a man, and which is be-<lb break="no"/>lieved
                    in every country to attack women.<lb break="yes"/>The animal killed in my time
                    at the foot of<lb break="yes"/>the mountains of Merida, and sent by the<lb
                        break="yes"/>name of <hi rendition="#i">salvaje</hi> to Colonel Ungaro,
                        the<lb break="yes"/>governor of the province Varinas, was in<lb break="yes"
                    />fact a bear, with black and smooth fur.&#x201D;</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>These extraordinary accounts are suc-<lb break="no"/>ceeded by a detailed history
                    of the Mos-<lb break="no"/>chettoes of this region; perhaps the most<lb

                    tormented by insects flying in the air,<lb break="yes"/>and how the multitude of

                    to speak in<lb break="yes"/>the open air. In the missions of the Oro-<lb

                    an inexhaustible subject of<lb break="yes"/>conversation. When two persons meet
                        in<lb break="yes"/>the morning, the first questions they address<lb
                        break="yes"/>to each other are, &#x2018;How did you find the<lb break="yes"

                    form of polite-<lb break="no"/>ness, which indicates the ancient state of<lb
                        break="yes"/>the country where it took birth. Salutations<lb break="yes"

                <p>&#x201C;At Mandavaca we found an old Mis-<lb break="no"/>sionary, who told us
