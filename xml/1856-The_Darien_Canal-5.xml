            <p>&#x2014;It is with the deepest satisfaction that I made myself acquainted,<lb/>during
                your short stay in Berlin, with the sound and extensive series of<lb/>measurements
                and levels which, by your direction, have been executed<lb/>since the beginning of
                January, 1855, upon the course of the great Rio<lb/>Atrato and its affluents on the
                West, by an able engineer, Mr. William Ken-<lb/>nish. This survey and those
                previously undertaken by your orders, and to<lb/>which my learned friend, Mr.
                Alexander Bache, Superintendent of the Coast<lb/>Survey of the United States, had
                already drawn my attention, are so much<lb/>the more deserving of regard, since you
                purpose to have examined with the<lb/>same precision the pass from the port of
                Cupica to the Rio Na&#x00EE;pi (Napipi),<lb/>and the points situated above the mouth
                of the Truando, which are all very<lb/>important in the solution of the vast problem
                of an oceanic canal.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>&#x201C;The great number of charts and sections on a large scale in your
                pos-<lb/>session furnish all the elements necessary for judging of the possibility
                of<lb/>establishing a communication between the two oceans by the mouths of
                the<lb/>Atrato, the Rio Truando, and a canal leading to the Pacific Ocean.
                It<lb/>was on account of his not having made so thorough an examination of
                the<lb/>mountainous country between the Gulf of San Miguel and Caledonia
                Bay<lb/>that Mr. Lionel Gisborne&#x2019;s plan of 1852 could not be carried out. The
                ig-<lb/>norance he was in as to the localities, and the absence of measurements
                of<lb/>altitude, led to the unfortunate issue of the courageous expedition of
                Lieu-<lb/>tenant Isaac Strain.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>&#x201C;The great object to be attained is, in my opinion, a canal which
                would<lb/>unite the two oceans without locks and without tunnels. When the
                plans<lb/>and sections can be placed before the public, a free and open discussion
                will<lb/>elucidate the advantages and disadvantages of each locality, and the
                execu-<lb/>tion of this important work, which interests the civilized nations of the
                two<lb/>continents, will be intrusted to engineers who have successfully
                distinguish-<lb/>ed themselves in similar enterprises. The Junction Company will
                find sub-<lb/>scribers among those governments and citizens who, yielding to a noble
                im-<lb/>pulse, will take pride in the idea of having contributed toward the
                execution<lb/>of a work worthy of the intellectual progress of the nineteenth
                century.<lb/>More than fifty years ago I earnestly expressed the same opinion, and
                I<lb/>have incessantly labored in the propagation of those geographical
                views,<lb/>which tend to prove the practicability of establishing commercial
                communi-<lb/>cations, either by canals (with or without either stop-gates or locks)
                or by<lb/>means of railroads uniting opposite coasts and rivers flowing in
                contrary<lb/>directions.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>&#x201C;I was the means of obtaining through General Bolivar the exact geo-<lb/>desic
                survey of the Isthmus of Panama; and I was the first, from informa-<lb/>tion found
                in the Archives of the Viceroyalty of Mexico, to lay down in<lb/>my Mexican Atlas
                the course of the two rivers, the Huasacualco and the<lb/><pb n="89" facs="#f0002"/>
                Chimalapa. I pointed out the proximity of the almost unknown port of<lb/>Cupica to
                the sources of the Rio Na&#x00EE;pi, and to the waters of the Atrato, and<lb/>also
                the existence, with which Europe was unacquainted, of a very small<lb/>navigable
                canal &#x2018;excavated&#x2019; in 1788, under the superintendence of a
                monk,<lb/>the Priest of Novita, by the Indians of his parish, in order to unite the
                wa-<lb/>ters of the Rio de la Raspadura, an affluent of the Rio de Quito
                (Quibdo),<lb/>to the waters of the Rio de San Juan de Chirambira.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>&#x201C;I think nothing more dangerous to the extension of commerce and to<lb/>the
                freedom of international relations than to inspire an aversion to all fu-<lb/>ture
                investigation by an absolute and imperious declaration that all hope of<lb/>an
                oceanic canal must now be abandoned. I expressly described in
                my<lb/>&#x2018;Political Essay on New Spain&#x2019; (compare vol. i., p. 202-248,
                with vol. ii.,<lb/>p. 95-145, 2d edition) the immense work of cutting through the
                mountains<lb/>an open channel for the Desague Huehuetoca, which was executed by
                the<lb/>Spanish government at the beginning of the seventeenth century, and
                I<lb/>have too much faith in the powerful means afforded by the present state
                of<lb/>civilization to be yet discouraged.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>&#x201C;The important communications for which I am indebted to the courtesy<lb/>of
                Colonel Augustus Codazzi and to the exceeding kindness of M. Pastor<lb/>Ospina,
                Minister of the Interior at Bogota, have made me fully aware that<lb/>the line from
                Cupica to the Rio Na&#x00EE;pi presents a series of elevations; in di-<lb/>recting
                this passage to be leveled you will, therefore, be rendering a farther<lb/>service
                to geography. Captain Robert Fitzroy, R.N., whose name is justly<lb/>renowned among
                navigators, in his &#x2018;Memoir on the Isthmus of Central<lb/>America,&#x2019;
                says: &#x2018;Of all the comparatively well-known routes, it has been<lb/>shown that
                the Atrato and Cupica line seems the most suitable for a canal,<lb/>and the Panama
                route for a railway. The officer who recently surveyed<lb/>Cupica (Lieutenant Wood,
                R.N.) states, with respect to the land between it<lb/>and the Na&#x00EE;pi, that he
                set out one morning from Cupica at eight o&#x2019;clock,<lb/>walked with native
                guides to the Na&#x00EE;pi, bathed in the stream, and reached<lb/>his ship (the
                Pandora) at noon.&#x2019; The most elevated ground was, in his<lb/>judgment, 300-400
                feet.&#x2014;Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, vol.<lb/>xx., 1850, part
                ii., p. 178.</p>
