    <p>Baron de Humboldt has addressed the following note to<lb/>the Berlin
                journals:&#x2014;&#x201C;Overwhelmed by the number of<lb/>letters sent, which are
                increasing every day, amounting<lb/>to from 1,600 to 2,000 per annum; many, too,
                being on<lb/>the most futile subjects, such as demands for my auto-<lb/>graph, and
                offers to cure me of all diseases; I once more<lb/>make a public appeal to the
                persons who wish me well,<lb/>and request them not to occupy themselves so much
                with<lb/>what concerns me, in order that with the diminution of<lb/>strength,
                physical and intellectual, which I experience,<lb/>I may be allowed a little leisure
                for study and composi-<lb/>tion. I trust that this step, to which I have recourse
                with<lb/>reluctance, will not be interpreted unkindly.&#x201D;</p><lb/></body><back></back>
