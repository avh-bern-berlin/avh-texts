<p>Baron Humboldt, in a memoir read<lb/>to the Institute 19th February last, 1821, entitled, &#x201C;New Ob-<lb/>servations on the Laws which we observe in the Distribution of<lb/>Vegetable Forms,&#x201D; states, that we already know nearly 56,000<lb/>species of cryptogamous and phanerogamous <hi rendition="#i">plants</hi>, 44,000<lb/>insects, 2,500 fishes, 700 reptiles, 4,000 birds, and 500 species<lb/>of mammifer&#x00E6;. In Europe alone, according to the researches<lb/>of M. Humboldt and M. Valenciennes, there exist nearly 80<lb/>mammifer&#x00E6;, 400 birds, and 30 reptiles. There are, of conse-<lb/>quence, under this temperate boreal zone, 5 times as many<lb/>species of birds as of mammifer&#x00E6;; as, in like manner, there are<lb/>in Europe 5 times as many composit&#x00E6; as amentaceous and co-<lb/>niferous plants; 5 times as many leguminous as there are of<lb/>orchideous and euphorbiaceous. The fine collections recently<lb/>brought home from the Cape of Good Hope by M. Delalande<lb/>prove, (if we compare them with the works of M. M. Temmink<lb/>and Levaillant,) that in that part of the temperate austral zone,<lb/>the mammifer&#x00E6; are also to the birds in the proportion of 1<lb/>to 4.3. Such an accordance between two opposite zones is<lb/><pb n="339" facs="#f0002" />
very striking. The birds, and especially the reptiles, increase<lb/>much more towards the equatorial zone than the mammifer&#x00E6;.<lb/>According to the discoveries of M. Cuvier on fossil bones, we<lb/>might believe, that these proportions have not been the same at<lb/>all times; and that there have disappeared, in the ancient ca-<lb/>tastrophes of our planet, many more mammifer&#x00E6; than birds.<lb/>We can conceive how, on a given space of territory, the indivi-<lb/>duals belonging to different tribes of plants and animals may be<lb/><hi rendition="#i">numerically limited;</hi> how, after an obstinate struggle and long<lb/>oscillations, a state of equilibrium comes to be established, re-<lb/>sulting from the necessities of nourishment and the habits of<lb/>life: but the causes which have <hi rendition="#i">limited the forms</hi> are hid under<lb/>an impenetrable veil, which withdraws from our view whatever<lb/>relates to the origin of things, or to the first developement of<lb/>organic life.</p><lb/><p>On the preponderance of certain families of plants depends<lb/>the character of the landscape; the aspect of a smiling or ma-<lb/>jestic nature. The abundance of gramine&#x00E6; which form vast<lb/>savannahs, that of palms and conifer&#x00E6;, have had a powerful<lb/>influence on the social conditon of nations, on their manners,<lb/>and the more or less rapid developement of the useful arts.<lb/>Sometimes a single species of plants, especially among those<lb/>styled, by M. Humboldt, <hi rendition="#i">social</hi>, covers a vast extent of country.<lb/>Such are, in the north, the heaths, and forests of pines; in<lb/>equinoctial America, the union of cactus, croton, bambusa, and<lb/>brathys of the same species.&#x2014;<hi rendition="#i">The sequel of this will be given in<lb/>our next Number.</hi></p><lb/></body><back></back>
