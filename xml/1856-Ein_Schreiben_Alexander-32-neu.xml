                    <div><p>You have written to me, my dear sir, as<lb/>you always do, a most amiable letter, but I am not
                    able to give you<lb/>my opinion upon the possibility of the existence of the
                    various kinds of<lb/>mineral, vegetable, animal, direct or indirect cerebral
                    electricity. I<lb/>have a holy horror of all kinds of pine-wood spiritualism and
                    psycho-<lb/>graphic mysticisms. You increase my horror by the ghost of
                    that<lb/>ephemeric being of reason, which is to receive intelligence from
                    the<lb/>thoughts of those persons who surround the table. You know
                    that<lb/>Geoffrey Saint Hilaire pretends to have sweat the oxyde of
                    thought<lb/>while in Egypt, and you, my dear friend, will say, that my
                    incredulity<lb/>is the simple consequence of my laziness. I submit willingly to
                    this<lb/>reproach, for I am convinced that the friendship which you
                    always<lb/>extended to me, will not be diminished if I can be instrumental
                    in<lb/>leading you out of the obscure path of error. I rely on your
                    forgive-<lb/>ness.</p><closer><salute>A. V. <hi rendition="#k">Humboldt.</hi>&#x201D;</salute></closer></div><lb/></body><back></back>
