                </head>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Before entering on a political<lb break="yes"/>view of the kingdom of New<lb break="yes"/>Spain, it may be of importance<lb break="yes"/>to bestow a rapid glance on the<lb break="yes"/>extent and population of the Spa-<lb break="no"/>nish possessions in the two A-<lb break="no"/>mericas. We must generalize<lb break="yes"/>our ideas, and consider each co-<lb break="no" />lony in its relations with the<lb break="yes"/>neighbouring colonies and with<lb break="yes"/>the mother country, if we would<lb break="yes"/>obtain accurate results, and as-<lb break="no"/>sign to the country described the<lb break="yes"/>place to which it is entitled from<lb break="yes"/>its territorial wealth.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The Spanish possessions of <placeName key="amerika">the<lb break="yes"/>new continent</placeName> occupy the im-<lb break="no"/>mense extent of territory com-<lb break="no"/>prised between the 41&#x00B0; 43 mi-<lb break="no"/>nutes of south latitude, and the<lb break="yes"/>37&#x00B0; 48 minutes of north latitude.<lb break="yes"/>This space of seventy-nine de-<lb break="no"/>grees equals not only the length<lb break="yes"/>of all <placeName key="afrika">Africa</placeName>, but it even much<lb break="yes"/>surpasses the breadth of the<lb break="yes"/>Russian empire, which includes<lb break="yes"/>
                    <cb/>about a hundred and sixty-seven<lb break="yes"/>degrees of longitude, under a<lb break="yes"/>parallel of which the degrees are<lb break="yes"/>not more than half the degrees<lb break="yes"/>of the <placeName key="aequator">equator</placeName>.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The most southern point of<lb break="yes"/>
                    <placeName key="amerika">the new continent</placeName> inhabited by<lb break="yes"/>the Spaniards is Fort Maullin,<lb break="yes"/>near the small village of Carel-<lb break="no"/>mapu, on the coast of Chili, op-<lb break="no" />posite the northern extremity of<lb break="yes"/>the island of Chiloe. A road is o-<lb break="no"/>pening from Valdivia to this fort<lb break="yes"/>of Maullin; a bold but useful un-<lb break="no"/>dertaking, as a stormy sea pre-<lb break="no"/>vents navigators for a great part<lb break="yes"/>of the year from landing on so<lb break="yes"/>dangerous a coast. On the south<lb break="yes"/>and south-east of Fort Maullin in<lb break="yes"/>the gulfs of Ancud and Relonca-<lb break="no"/>vi, by which we reach the great<lb break="yes" />lakes of Nahuelhapi and Todos<lb break="yes"/>los Santos, there are no Spanish<lb break="yes"/>establishments; but we meet with<lb break="yes" />them in the islands near the eas-<lb break="no"/>tern coast of Chiloe, even in 43&#x00B0;<lb break="yes"/>34 minutes of south latitude,<lb break="yes"/>where the island Caylin (opposite<lb break="yes"/>the lofty summit of the Corcoba-<lb break="no"/>do) is inhabited by several fami-<lb break="no"/>lies of Spanish origin.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The most northern point of<lb break="yes"/>the Spanish colonies is the mis-<lb break="no"/>sion of San Francisco, on the<lb break="yes"/>coast of New California, seven<lb break="yes"/>leagues to the north-west of San-<lb break="no"/>ta Cruz. The Spanish language<lb break="yes"/>is thus spread over an extent of<lb break="yes"/>more than one thousand nine<lb break="yes" />hundred leagues in length. Un-<lb break="no"/>der the wise administration of<lb break="yes"/>count Florida Blanca, a regular<lb break="yes" />communication of posts was es-<lb break="no"/>tablished from Paraguay to the<lb break="yes"/>north-west coast of North Ame-<lb break="no"/>rica; and a monk in the mission<lb break="yes"/>of the Guaranis Indians can main-<lb break="no"/>tain a correspondence with ano-<lb break="no"/>ther missionary inhabiting New<lb break="yes"/>Mexico, or the countries in the<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="269" facs="#f0002"/>
                    <cb/>neighbourhood of Cape Mendo-<lb break="no"/>cin, without their letters ever<lb break="yes"/>passing at any great distance from<lb break="yes"/>the continent of <placeName key="spanischeskolonialreich">Spanish America</placeName>.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The dominions of the king of<lb break="yes"/>Spain in <placeName key="amerika">America</placeName> exceed in ex-<lb break="no"/>tent the vast regions possessed by<lb break="yes"/>the Russian empire, or Great<lb break="yes" />Britain, in <placeName key="asien">Asia</placeName>. I thought,<lb break="yes" />therefore, that a view of these<lb break="yes"/>differences and of the striking<lb break="yes"/>disproportion between the area<lb break="yes"/>and the population of the mother<lb break="yes"/>country, compared with those of<lb break="yes"/>the colonies, could hardly fail to<lb break="yes"/>be interesting. To make this<lb break="yes"/>disproportion appear still more<lb break="yes"/>palpable, I have formed, accord-<lb break="no"/>ing to exact scales, the drawings<lb break="yes"/>in the last plate. A red parallel-<lb break="no"/>ogram which serves for the base,<lb break="yes"/>represents the surface of the mo-<lb break="no"/>ther countries; and a blue paral-<lb break="no"/>lelogram which reposes on the<lb break="yes"/>base, indicates the area of the<lb break="yes"/>Spanish and English possessions<lb break="yes" />in <placeName key="amerika">America</placeName> and <placeName key="asien">Asia</placeName>. These<lb break="yes"/>views, similar to those of M.<lb break="yes"/>Playfair, have something fearful<lb break="yes"/>in them, particularly when we<lb break="yes"/>fix our eyes on the grand catas-<lb break="no"/>trophe represented in the fourth<lb break="yes"/>figure, of which the memory is<lb break="yes"/>still recent among us. This<lb break="yes" />plate alone should suggest im-<lb break="no"/>portant considerations to those<lb break="yes"/>who superintend the prosperity<lb break="yes"/>and tranquillity of the colonies.<lb break="yes"/>The dread of a future evil is un-<lb break="no"/>doubtedly in itself a motive of<lb break="yes"/>no great dignity; but it is a pow-<lb break="no"/>erful motive of vigilance and ac-<lb break="no"/>tivity for great political bodies as<lb break="yes"/>well as for simple individuals.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The <placeName key="spanischeskolonialreich">Spanish possessions in<lb break="yes"/>America</placeName> are divided into nine<lb break="yes" />great governments, which may<lb break="yes"/>be regarded as independent of one<lb break="yes"/>another. Of these nine govern-<lb break="no"/>ments, five, viz. the viceroyalties<lb break="yes"/>
                    <cb/>of Peru and of New Grenada, the<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">capitanias generales</hi> of Guatima-<lb break="no"/>la, of Portorico, and of Caraccas,<lb break="yes"/>are wholly comprised in the tor-<lb break="no"/>rid zone; the four other divisi-<lb break="no"/>ons, viz. the viceroyalties of Mex-<lb break="no"/>ico and Buenos Ayres, the <hi rendition="#i">capi-<lb break="no"/>tanias generales</hi> of Chili and Ha-<lb break="no"/>vannah, including the Floridas,<lb break="yes"/>are composed of countries of<lb break="yes"/>which a great part is situated<lb break="yes"/>without the tropics, that is to say,<lb break="yes"/>in the temperate zone. We shall<lb break="yes"/>afterwards see that this position<lb break="yes"/>alone does not determine the na-<lb break="no"/>ture of the productions of these<lb break="yes"/>fine regions. The union of se-<lb break="no"/>veral physical causes, such as the<lb break="yes"/>great height of the Cordilleras,<lb break="yes"/>their enormous masses, the num-<lb break="no"/>ber of plains, elevated more than<lb break="yes"/>from two to three thousand me-<lb break="no"/>tres<note place="foot" n="*">From 6,561 feet to 9,842 feet.<lb break="yes"/>

The geo-<lb break="no"/>graphical latitude has small in-<lb break="no"/>fluence on the fertility of a coun-<lb break="no"/>try, where, on the ridge and de-<lb break="no"/>clivity of the mountains, nature<lb break="yes"/>exhibits a union of every cli-<lb break="no"/>mate.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Among the colonies subject to<lb break="yes"/>the king of Spain, Mexico occu-<lb break="no"/>pies at present the first rank,<lb break="yes"/>both on account of its territorial<lb break="yes"/>wealth, and on account of its fa-<lb break="no"/>vourable position for commerce<lb break="yes"/>with Europe and <placeName key="asien">Asia</placeName>. We<lb break="yes"/>speak here merely of the politi-<lb break="no"/>cal value of the country, consi-<lb break="no"/>dering it in its actual state of ci-<lb break="no"/>vilization, which is very superior<lb break="yes"/>to that of the other Spanish pos-<lb break="no"/>sessions. Many branches of a-<lb break="no"/>
                    <pb n="270" facs="#f0003"/>
                    <cb/>griculture have undoubtedly at-<lb break="no"/>tained a higher degree of per-<lb break="no"/>fection in the province of Carac-<lb break="no"/>cas than in New Spain. The<lb break="yes"/>fewer mines a colony has, the<lb break="yes"/>more the industry of the inhabi-<lb break="no"/>tants is turned towards the pro-<lb break="no"/>ductions of the vegetable king-<lb break="no" />dom. The fertility of the soil is<lb break="yes"/>greater in the provinces of Cu-<lb break="no"/>mana, of <placeName key="barcelona">New Barcelona</placeName>, and<lb break="yes"/>Venezuela; and it is greater on<lb break="yes"/>the banks of the <placeName key="baxoorinoco">lower Orinoco</placeName>,<lb break="yes"/>and in the northern part of New<lb break="yes"/>Grenada, than in the kingdom of<lb break="yes"/>Mexico, of which several regions<lb break="yes"/>are barren, destitute of water,<lb break="yes"/>and incapable of vegetation. But<lb break="yes"/>on considering the greatness of<lb break="yes"/>the population of Mexico, the<lb break="yes" />number of considerable cities in<lb break="yes"/>the proximity of one another,<lb break="yes"/>the enormous value of the metal-<lb break="no"/>lic produce, and its influence on<lb break="yes"/>the commerce of Europe and<lb break="yes"/>
                    <placeName key="asien">Asia</placeName>; in short, on examining the<lb break="yes"/>imperfect state of cultivation ob-<lb break="no"/>servable in the rest of <placeName key="spanischeskolonialreich">Spanish<lb break="yes" />America</placeName> we are tempted to justi-<lb break="no"/>fy the preference which the court<lb break="yes"/>of Madrid has long manifested<lb break="yes"/>for Mexico above its other colo-<lb break="no"/>nies.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The denomination of New<lb break="yes"/>Spain designates, in general, the<lb break="yes"/>vast extent of country over<lb break="yes"/>which the viceroy of Mexico ex-<lb break="no"/>ercises his power. Using the<lb break="yes"/>word in this sense, we are to<lb break="yes"/>consider as northern and south-<lb break="no"/>ern limits the parallels of the<lb break="yes"/>38th and 10th degrees of latitude.<lb break="yes"/>But the captain-general of Gua-<lb break="no"/>timala, considered as administra-<lb break="no"/>tor, depends very little on the<lb break="yes"/>viceroy of New Spain. The<lb break="yes" />kingdom of Guatimala contains,<lb break="yes"/>according to its political division,<lb break="yes"/>the governments of Costa Rica,<lb break="yes"/>and of Nicaragua. It is conter-<lb break="no"/>

                <p>Towards the beginning of the<lb break="yes"/>16th century, the river of Santia-<lb break="no"/>go separated the agricultural na-<lb break="no" />tions of Mexico and Mechoacan<lb break="yes"/>from the barbarous and pastoral<lb break="yes"/>hordes called Otomites and Cici-<lb break="no" />mecs. These savages frequently<lb break="yes"/>carried their incursions as far as<lb break="yes"/>Tula, a town situated near the<lb break="yes"/>northern bank of the valley of<lb break="yes"/>Tenochtitlan.

                <p>Neither should the denomina-<lb break="no"/>tion of <placeName key="anahuac">Anahuac</placeName> be confounded<lb break="yes"/>with that of New Spain. Before<lb break="yes"/>the conquest, all the country be-<lb break="no" />tween the 14th and 21st degrees<lb break="yes"/>of latitude was included under<lb break="yes"/>the name of <placeName key="anahuac">Anahuac</placeName>. Besides<lb break="yes"/>the Aztec empire of Montezu-<lb break="no"/>ma, the small republics of Tlax-<lb break="no" />callan and Cholollan, the king-<lb break="no"/>doms of Tezcuco (or Acolhoa-<lb break="no"/>can) and Mechuacan, which com-<lb break="no"/>prised part of the intendancy of<lb break="yes"/>Valladolid, belonged to the an-<lb break="no" />cient <placeName key="anahuac">Anahuac</placeName>.</p>

It<lb break="yes"/>appears, however, that before the<lb break="yes"/>year 1530 the city was more<lb break="yes"/>commonly called Tenochtitlan<lb break="yes"/>than Mexico. <persName key="cortes_h">Cortez</persName>,<note place="foot" n="*">Historia de Nueva Espana, por<lb break="yes"/>Lorenzana, (Mexico, 1770 p. 1.)</note> who had<lb break="yes"/>made very little progress in the<lb break="yes"/>language of the country, called<lb break="yes"/>the capital, through corruption,<lb break="yes"/>Temixtitan.

                        <persName key="cortes_h">Cortez</persName> says, in his first letter,<lb break="yes"/>dated from Villa Segura de la Fron-<lb break="no"/>tera, the 30th October, 1520: &#x201C;Las<lb break="yes"/>cosas de esta terra son tantas y tales<lb break="yes"/>que Vuestra Alteza se puede entitular<lb break="yes"/>de nuevo Emperador de ella, y con<lb break="yes"/>titulo y non menos merito, que el de<lb break="yes"/>Alemana, que por la gracia de Dios<lb break="yes"/>Vuestra Sacra Magestad possee.&#x201D; (Lo-<lb break="no"/>renzana, p. 38.)</note> Charles V. to unite the title<lb break="yes"/>of emperor of New Spain to that<lb break="yes"/>of Roman emperor.</p>

                <p>We are tempted to compare<lb break="yes"/>together the extent and popula-<lb break="no"/>tion of Mexico, and that of two<lb break="yes"/>empires with which this fine co-<lb break="no"/>lony is in relations of union and<lb break="yes"/>rivalry.

Should no<lb break="yes"/>unforeseen misfortunes occur,<lb break="yes" />we may reckon that in less than<lb break="yes"/>a century the population of New<lb break="yes"/>Spain will equal that of the mo-<lb break="no"/>ther country.

                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>If the political force of two<lb break="yes"/>states depended solely on the<lb break="yes"/>space which they occupy on the<lb break="yes"/>globe, and on the number of<lb break="yes"/>their inhabitants; if the nature of<lb break="yes" />the soil, the configuration of the<lb break="yes"/>coast; and if the climate, the e-<lb break="no"/>nergy of the nation, and above all<lb break="yes"/>the degree of perfection of its<lb break="yes"/>social institutions, were not the<lb break="yes"/>principal elements of this grand<lb break="yes"/>dynamical calculation, the king-<lb break="no"/>dom of New Spain might, at<lb break="yes" />present, be placed in opposition<lb break="yes"/>to the confederation of the A-<lb break="no"/>merican republics. Both labour<lb break="yes"/>under the inconvenience of an<lb break="yes"/>unequally distributed population;<lb break="yes"/>but that of the United States,<lb break="yes"/>though in a soil and climate less<lb break="yes"/>favoured by nature, augments<lb break="yes" />with an infinitely greater rapidi-<lb break="no"/>ty. Neither does it comprehend,<lb break="yes"/>like the Mexican population,<lb break="yes" />nearly two millions and a half of<lb break="yes"/>aborigines. These Indians, de-<lb break="no"/>graded by the despotism of the<lb break="yes"/>ancient Aztec sovereigns, and by<lb break="yes"/>the vexations of the first conque-<lb break="no"/>rors, though protected by the<lb break="yes"/>Spanish laws, wise and humane<lb break="yes"/>in general, enjoy very little, how-<lb break="no" />ever, of this protection, from the<lb break="yes"/>great distance of the supreme<lb break="yes"/>authority. The kingdom of New<lb break="yes"/>Spain has one decided advantage<lb break="yes"/>over the United States. The<lb break="yes"/>number of slaves there either<lb break="yes"/>Africans or of mixed race, is<lb break="yes"/>almost nothing; an advantage<lb break="yes" />which the European colonists<lb break="yes"/>have only begun rightly to appre-<lb break="no"/>ciate since the tragical events of<lb break="yes"/>the revolution of St. Domingo.<lb break="yes"/>So true it is, that the fear of phy-<lb break="no"/>sical evils acts more powerfully<lb break="yes"/>

                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The number of African slaves<lb break="yes"/>in the United States amounts to<lb break="yes"/>more than a million, and consti-<lb break="no"/>tute a sixth part of the whole<lb break="yes"/>population.

                <p>The Mexican population is<lb break="yes"/>composed of the same elements<lb break="yes"/>as the other Spanish colonies.<lb break="yes"/>They reckon seven races: 1.<lb break="yes"/>The individuals born in Europe,<lb break="yes" />vulgarly called Gachupines; 2.<lb break="yes"/>The Spanish Creoles, or whites<lb break="yes"/>of European extraction born in<lb break="yes"/><placeName key="amerika">America</placeName>; 3.

                <p>A very general prejudice ex-<lb break="no"/>ists in Europe that an exceeding<lb break="yes"/>small number of the copper-co-<lb break="no"/>loured race, or descendants of the<lb break="yes"/>ancient Mexicans, remain at this<lb break="yes"/>day. The cruelty of the Euro-<lb break="no"/>peans has entirely extirpated the<lb break="yes"/>old inhabitants of the West In-<lb break="no" />dies. The continent of Ameri-<lb break="no"/>ca, however, has witnessed no<lb break="yes"/>such horrible result. The num-<lb break="no"/>ber of Indians in New Spain ex-<lb break="no"/>
                    <cb/>ceeds two millions and a half, in-<lb break="no"/>cluding only those who have no<lb break="yes"/>mixture of European or African<lb break="yes"/>blood. What is still more con-<lb break="no"/>solatory, and we repeat it, is, that<lb break="yes"/>the indigenous population far<lb break="yes"/>from declining, has been consi-<lb break="no"/>derably on the increase for the<lb break="yes" />last fifty years, as is proved by<lb break="yes"/>the registers of capitation or tri-<lb break="no"/>bute.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>In general the Indians appear to<lb break="yes"/>form two-fifths of the whole popu-<lb break="no"/>lation of Mexico.

This ingeni-<lb break="no"/>ous opinion will appear less pro-<lb break="no"/>bable if we consider the great<lb break="yes"/>distance which these colonists<lb break="yes"/>would have to travel, and reflect<lb break="yes" />that the Mexican, cultivation did<lb break="yes"/>not extend beyond the 20&#x00B0; of la-<lb break="no"/>titude. I am rather inclined to<lb break="yes"/>believe, that, on the migration of<lb break="yes"/>the Toultecs and Aztecs to the<lb break="yes"/>south, some tribes remained on<lb break="yes"/>the coasts of New Norfolk and<lb break="yes"/>New Cornwall, while the rest<lb break="yes" />continued their course south-<lb break="no"/>wards.

                    <lb break="yes"/>that the Toultecs, or Aztecs,<lb break="yes"/>might be a part of those Hiong-<lb break="no"/>noux, who, according to the Chi-<lb break="no" />nese historians, emigrated under<lb break="yes"/>their leader Punon, and were lost<lb break="yes"/>in the north parts of Siberia.<lb break="yes"/>This nation of warrior-shepherds<lb break="yes"/>has more than once changed the<lb break="yes"/>face of oriental <placeName key="asien">Asia</placeName>, and deso-<lb break="no"/>lated, under the name of Huns,<lb break="yes"/>the finest parts of civilized Eu-<lb break="no"/>rope.

                        <cb/>continent</placeName>; an analogy, which,<lb break="yes"/>according to the latest researches<lb break="yes"/>of M. <persName key="barton_bs">Barton Smith</persName>, extends on-<lb break="no"/>ly to a very small number of<lb break="yes"/>words. The want of wheat, oats,<lb break="yes"/>barley, rye, and all those nutritive<lb break="yes"/>gramina which go under the ge-<lb break="no"/>neral name of cereal, seems to<lb break="yes"/>prove, that if Asiatic tribes pas-<lb break="no"/>sed into <placeName key="amerika">America</placeName>, they must<lb break="yes"/>have descended from pastoral<lb break="yes"/>people. We see in the old con-<lb break="no" />tinent that the cultivation of ce-<lb break="no"/>real gramina, and the use of milk,<lb break="yes"/>were introduced as far back as<lb break="yes"/>we have any historical records.<lb break="yes"/>The inhabitants of the new con-<lb break="no"/>tinent cultivated no other grami-<lb break="no"/>na than maize, (Zea.)

                <p>Without losing ourselves in<lb break="yes"/>suppositions as to the first coun-<lb break="no"/>try of the Toultecs and the Az-<lb break="no"/>tecs, and without attempting to<lb break="yes"/>fix the geographical position of<lb break="yes" />those ancient kingdoms of Hue-<lb break="no"/>huetlapallan and <placeName key="aztlan">Aztlan</placeName>, we shall<lb break="yes"/>confine ourselves to the accounts<lb break="yes"/>of the Spanish historians. The<lb break="yes" />northern provinces, New Biscay,<lb break="yes"/>Sonora, and New Mexico, were<lb break="yes"/>very thinly inhabited in the 16th<lb break="yes" />century.

But<lb break="yes"/>in the northern provinces, the<lb break="yes"/>natives yielded to the conquerors<lb break="yes"/>their uncultivated savannas, which<lb break="yes"/>served for pasturage to the buf-<lb break="no"/>faloes. The Indians took refuge<lb break="yes"/>beyond the Rio Gila, towards the<lb break="yes"/>Rio Zaguanas and the mountains<lb break="yes"/>de las Grullas. The Indian tribes<lb break="yes"/>who formerly occupied the terri-<lb break="no" />tory of the United States and<lb break="yes"/>Canada followed the same policy;<lb break="yes"/>and chose rather to withdraw,<lb break="yes"/>first, behind the <placeName key="allegheny">Alleghany moun-<lb break="no" />tains</placeName>, then behind the Ohio, and<lb break="yes"/>lastly behind the Missouri, to a-<lb break="no"/>void being forced to live among<lb break="yes"/>the Europeans. From the same<lb break="yes"/>cause we find the copper-colour-<lb break="no"/>ed race neither in the provincias in-<lb break="no"/>ternas of New Spain, nor in the<lb break="yes"/>cultivated parts of the U. States.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The migrations of the Ameri-<lb break="no"/>can tribes having been constantly<lb break="yes"/>carried on from north to south, at<lb break="yes"/>least between the sixth and<lb break="yes"/>twelfth centuries, it is certain<lb break="yes"/>that the Indian population of New<lb break="yes"/>Spain must be composed of very<lb break="yes"/>heterogeneous elements. In pro-<lb break="no" />portion as the population flowed<lb break="yes"/>towards the south, some tribes<lb break="yes"/>would stop in their progress, and<lb break="yes" />mingle with the tribes which fol-<lb break="no"/>lowed them. The great variety<lb break="yes"/>of languages still spoken in the<lb break="yes" />kingdom of Mexico proves a<lb break="yes"/>great variety of races and origin.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The number of these lan-<lb break="no"/>guages exceeds twenty, of which<lb break="yes"/>fourteen have grammars and dic-<lb break="no"/>tionaries tolerably complete. The<lb break="yes"/>following are their names: the<lb break="yes"/>Mexican or Aztec language; the<lb break="yes"/>Otomite; the Tarasc; the Za-<lb break="no"/>potec; the Mistec; the Maye or<lb break="yes"/>

It appears<lb break="yes" />that the most part of these lan-<lb break="no"/>guages, far from being dialects<lb break="yes"/>of the same, (as some authors<lb break="yes"/>have falsely advanced,) are at<lb break="yes"/>least as different from one ano-<lb break="no"/>ther as the Greek and the Ger-<lb break="no"/>man, or the French and Polish.<lb break="yes"/>This is the case at least with the<lb break="yes" />seven languages of New Spain,<lb break="yes"/>of which I possess the vocabula-<lb break="no"/>ries. The variety of idioms<lb break="yes"/>spoken by the people of <placeName key="amerika">the new<lb break="yes" />continent</placeName>, and which, without the<lb break="yes"/>least exaggeration, may be stated<lb break="yes"/>at some hundreds, offers a very<lb break="yes"/>striking phenomenon, particular-<lb break="no"/>ly when we compare it with the<lb break="yes"/>few languages spoken in <placeName key="asien">Asia</placeName>

                <p>The Mexican language, that<lb break="yes"/>of the Aztecs, is the most widely<lb break="yes"/>diffused, and extends at present<lb break="yes"/>from the 37&#x00B0; to the lake of Ni-<lb break="no"/>caragua, for a length of 400<lb break="yes" />leagues.

                <p>To give an accurate idea of<lb break="yes"/>the indigenous inhabitants of<lb break="yes"/>New Spain, it is not enough to<lb break="yes"/>paint them in their actual state<lb break="yes"/>of degradation and misery; we<lb break="yes" />must go back to a remote period,<lb break="yes"/>when governed by its own laws,<lb break="yes"/>the nation could display its pro-<lb break="no"/>per energy; and we must con-<lb break="no"/>sult the hieroglyphical paintings,<lb break="yes"/>

These research-<lb break="no"/>es are reserved for the historical<lb break="yes" />account of our expedition to the<lb break="yes"/>tropics. The nature of this work<lb break="yes"/>does not permit us to enter into<lb break="yes"/>such details, however interesting<lb break="yes"/>they may be, both for the history,<lb break="yes"/>and the psychological study of<lb break="yes"/>our species. We shall merely<lb break="yes"/>point out here a few of the most<lb break="yes"/>prominent features of the im-<lb break="no"/>mense picture of American in-<lb break="no"/>digenous population.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The Indians of New Spain<lb break="yes"/>bear a general resemblance to<lb break="yes"/>those who inhabit Canada, Flori-<lb break="no"/>da, Peru, and Brasil. They have<lb break="yes"/>the same swarthy and copper co-<lb break="no" />lour, flat and smooth hair, small<lb break="yes"/>beard, squat body, long eye with<lb break="yes"/>the corner directed upwards to-<lb break="no"/>wards the temples, prominent<lb break="yes"/>cheek bones, thick lips, and an<lb break="yes"/>expression of gentleness in the<lb break="yes"/>mouth, strongly contrasted with<lb break="yes"/>a gloomy and severe look. The<lb break="yes" />American race, after the hyper-<lb break="no"/>borean race, is the least nume-<lb break="no"/>rous; but it occupies the great-<lb break="no"/>est space on the globe. Over a<lb break="yes"/>million and a half of square<lb break="yes"/>leagues, from the Terra del<lb break="yes"/>Fuego islands to the river St.<lb break="yes"/>Laurence and <placeName key="beringstrase">Baring&#x2019;s Straits</placeName>,<lb break="yes"/>we are struck at the first glance<lb break="yes"/>with the general resemblance in<lb break="yes"/>the features of the inhabitants.<lb break="yes"/>We think we perceive that they<lb break="yes"/>all descend from the same stock,<lb break="yes" />notwithstanding the enormous<lb break="yes"/>diversity of language which se-<lb break="no"/>parates them from one another.<lb break="yes"/>However, when we reflect more<lb break="yes"/>seriously on this family likeness,<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="278" facs="#f0011"/>
                    <cb/>after living longer among the in-<lb break="no"/>digenous Americans, we discover<lb break="yes"/>that celebrated travellers, who<lb break="yes" />could only observe a few indivi-<lb break="no"/>duals on the coasts, have singu-<lb break="no"/>larly exaggerated the analogy of<lb break="yes"/>form among the Americans.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Intellectual cultivation is what<lb break="yes"/>contributes the most to diversify<lb break="yes"/>the features. In barbarous na-<lb break="no" />tions there is rather a physiogno-<lb break="no"/>my peculiar to the tribe or horde<lb break="yes"/>than to any individual. When<lb break="yes"/>we compare our domestic ani-<lb break="no"/>mals with those which inhabit<lb break="yes"/>our forests we make the same<lb break="yes"/>observation. But a European,<lb break="yes"/>when he decides on the great re-<lb break="no" />semblance among the copper-co-<lb break="no"/>loured races, is subject to a par-<lb break="no"/>ticular illusion. He is struck<lb break="yes"/>with a complexion so different<lb break="yes"/>from our own, and the uniformi-<lb break="no"/>ty of this complexion conceals<lb break="yes"/>for a long time from him the di-<lb break="no"/>versity of individual features.<lb break="yes" />The new colonist can hardly at<lb break="yes"/>first distinguish the indigenous,<lb break="yes"/>because his eyes are less fixed<lb break="yes" />on the gentle melancholic or fe-<lb break="no"/>rocious expression of the coun-<lb break="no"/>tenance than on the red coppery<lb break="yes"/>colour and dark luminous and<lb break="yes"/>coarse and glossy hair, so glossy<lb break="yes"/>indeed that we should believe it<lb break="yes"/>to be in a constant state of hu-<lb break="no"/>mectation.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>In the faithful portrait which<lb break="yes"/>an excellent observer, M. Vol-<lb break="no"/>ney, has drawn of the Canada<lb break="yes"/>Indians, we undoubtedly recog-<lb break="no"/>nise the tribes scattered in the<lb break="yes"/>meadows of the <placeName key="apure">Rio Apure</placeName> and<lb break="yes"/>the Carony. The same style of<lb break="yes"/>feature exists no doubt in <placeName key="amerika">both<lb break="yes" />Americas</placeName>; but those Europeans<lb break="yes"/>who have sailed on the great ri-<lb break="no"/>vers Orinoco and <placeName key="amazonas">Amazons</placeName>, and<lb break="yes"/>have had occasion to see a great<lb break="yes"/>number of tribes assembled un-<lb break="no"/>

The tall<lb break="yes"/>form of the Pantagonians, who<lb break="yes"/>inhabit the southern extremity of<lb break="yes"/>

                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The Indians of New Spain<lb break="yes"/>have a more swarthy complexion<lb break="yes"/>than the inhabitants of the warm-<lb break="no"/>est climates of <placeName key="suedamerika">South America</placeName>.<lb break="yes"/>This fact is so much the more<lb break="yes"/>remarkable, as in the race of<lb break="yes"/>Caucasus, which may be also<lb break="yes"/>

                    <cb/>called the European Arab race,<lb break="yes"/>the people of the south have not<lb break="yes"/>so fair a skin as those of the<lb break="yes"/>north. Though many of the A-<lb break="no"/>siatic nations who inundated Eu-<lb break="no"/>rope in the sixth century had a<lb break="yes"/>very dark complexion, it appears,<lb break="yes"/>however, that the shades of co-<lb break="no"/>lour observable among the white<lb break="yes"/>race are less owing to their ori-<lb break="no"/>gin or mixture than to the local<lb break="yes"/>influence of the climate. This<lb break="yes"/>influence appears to have almost<lb break="yes"/>no effect on the Americans and<lb break="yes"/>negroes.

The negroes of the<lb break="yes"/>mountains of Upper Guinea are<lb break="yes"/>not less black than those who<lb break="yes"/>live on the coast. There are, no<lb break="yes"/>doubt, tribes of colour by no<lb break="yes"/>means deep among the Indians<lb break="yes"/>of <placeName key="amerika">the new continent</placeName>, whose<lb break="yes"/>complexion approaches to that of<lb break="yes"/>the Arabs or Moors. We found<lb break="yes"/>the people of the Rio Negro<lb break="yes"/>swarthier than those of the <placeName key="baxoorinoco">Low-<lb break="no"/>er Orinoco</placeName>, and yet the banks of<lb break="yes"/>the first of these rivers enjoy a<lb break="yes"/>much cooler climate than the<lb break="yes"/>more northern regions. In the<lb break="yes"/>forests of Guiana, especially near<lb break="yes"/>the sources of the Orinoco, are<lb break="yes"/>several tribes of a whitish com-<lb break="no"/>plexion, the Guaicas, Guajaribs,<lb break="yes"/>and Arigues, of whom, several<lb break="yes"/>robust individuals, exhibiting no<lb break="yes" />symptom of the asthenical mala-<lb break="no"/>dy which characterises <hi rendition="#i">albinos</hi>,<lb break="yes"/>have the appearance of true<lb break="yes"/>Mestizoes.

                <p>The Indians of New Spain,<lb break="yes"/>those at least subject to the Eu-<lb break="no"/>ropean domination, generally at-<lb break="no"/>tain a pretty advanced age&#x2014;<lb break="yes"/>Peaceable cultivators, and col-<lb break="no"/>lected these six hundred years<lb break="yes"/>in villages, they are not exposed<lb break="yes"/>to the accidents of the wander-<lb break="no" />ing life of the hunters and war-<lb break="no"/>riors of the Mississippi and the<lb break="yes"/>savannas of the Rio Gila. Accus-<lb break="no"/>tomed to uniform nourishment of<lb break="yes"/>an almost entirely vegetable na-<lb break="no"/>ture, that of their maize and ce-<lb break="no"/>real gramina, the Indians would<lb break="yes"/>undoubtedly attain a very great<lb break="yes" />longevity if their constitutions<lb break="yes"/>were not weakened by drunken-<lb break="no"/>
                    <cb/>ness. Their intoxicating liquors<lb break="yes"/>are rum, a fermentation of maize<lb break="yes"/>and the root of the jatropha, and<lb break="yes" />especially the wine of the coun-<lb break="no"/>try, made of the juice of the<lb break="yes"/>agave americana, called pulque.<lb break="yes"/>This last liquor, of which we<lb break="yes"/>shall have occasion to speak in<lb break="yes"/>the following book, is even nu-<lb break="no"/>tritive, on account of the unde-<lb break="no"/>composed sugar which it con-<lb break="no" />tains.

                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The vice of drunkenness is,<lb break="yes"/>however, less general among the<lb break="yes"/>Indians than is generally believ-<lb break="no"/>ed. Those Europeans who have<lb break="yes"/>travelled to the east of the <placeName key="allegheny">Alleg-<lb break="no"/>hany</placeName> mountains, between the O-<lb break="no"/>hio and Missouri, will with diffi-<lb break="no"/>culty believe that, in the forests<lb break="yes"/>of Guiana and on the banks of the<lb break="yes"/>Orinoco, we saw Indians who<lb break="yes"/>showed an aversion for the bran-<lb break="no"/>dy which we made them taste.<lb break="yes"/>There are several Indian tribes,<lb break="yes"/>very sober, whose fermented be-<lb break="no"/>verages are too weak to intoxi-<lb break="no" />cate. In New Spain drunkenness<lb break="yes"/>is most common among the In-<lb break="no"/>dians who inhabit the valley of<lb break="yes"/>Mexico, and the environs of<lb break="yes"/>Puebla and Tlascala, wherever<lb break="yes"/>the maguey or agave are culti-<lb break="no"/>vated on a great scale. The police<lb break="yes"/>in the city of Mexico sends round<lb break="yes"/>tumbrels, to collect the drunk-<lb break="no"/>ards to be found stretched out in<lb break="yes"/>the streets. These Indians, who<lb break="yes"/>are treated like dead bodies, are<lb break="yes"/>carried to the principal guard-<lb break="no"/>house.

                <p>When we examine savage hun-<lb break="no"/>ters or warriors we are tempted<lb break="yes"/>to believe that they are all well<lb break="yes"/>made, because those who have<lb break="yes"/>any natural deformity either pe-<lb break="no" />rish from fatigue or are exposed<lb break="yes"/>by their parents, but the Mexican<lb break="yes"/>and Peruvian Indians, those of<lb break="yes"/>Quito and New Granada, are ag-<lb break="no"/>riculturists, who can only be com-<lb break="no"/>pared with the class of European<lb break="yes"/>peasantry.

                <p>When the Spaniards made the<lb break="yes"/>conquest of Mexico, they found the<lb break="yes"/>people in that state of abject sub-<lb break="no"/>mission and poverty which every-<lb break="no"/>where accompanies despotism and<lb break="yes"/>feudality. The emperor, princes,<lb break="yes"/>nobility, and clergy, (the teopix-<lb break="no"/>qui,) alone possessed the most<lb break="yes"/>fertile lands; the governors of<lb break="yes"/>provinces indulged with impuni-<lb break="no"/>ty in the most severe exactions;<lb break="yes"/>and the cultivator was every-<lb break="no"/>where degraded. The highways,<lb break="yes"/>as we have already observed,<lb break="yes" />swarmed with mendicants; and<lb break="yes"/>the want of large quadrupeds<lb break="yes"/>forced thousands of Indians to<lb break="yes"/>perform the functions of beasts<lb break="yes"/>of burden, and to transport the<lb break="yes"/>maize, cotton, hides, and other<lb break="yes"/>commodities, which the more<lb break="yes"/>remote provinces sent by way of<lb break="yes" />tribute to the capital. The con-<lb break="no"/>quest rendered the state of the<lb break="yes"/>lower people still more deplora-<lb break="no"/>ble. The cultivator was torn<lb break="yes"/>from the soil, and dragged to the<lb break="yes"/>mountains, where the working<lb break="yes"/>of the mines commenced; and a<lb break="yes"/>great number of Indians were o-<lb break="no" />bliged to follow the armies, and<lb break="yes"/>to carry, without sufficient nou-<lb break="no"/>rishment or repose, through<lb break="yes"/>mountainous woods, burdens<lb break="yes"/>which exceeded their strength.<lb break="yes" />All Indian property, whether in<lb break="yes"/>land or goods, was conceived to<lb break="yes"/>belong to the conqueror. This<lb break="yes"/>atrocious principle was even<lb break="yes"/>sanctioned by a law, which as-<lb break="no" />signs to the Indians a small por-<lb break="no"/>tion of ground around the newly<lb break="yes"/>constructed churches.</p>

                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Mexico is the country of ine-<lb break="no"/>quality. No where does there<lb break="yes"/>exist such a fearful difference in<lb break="yes"/>the distribution of fortune, civili-<lb break="no"/>zation, cultivation of the soil, and<lb break="yes"/>population. The interior of the<lb break="yes"/>country contains four cities, which<lb break="yes"/>are not more than one or two<lb break="yes"/>days journey distant from one an-<lb break="no"/>other, and possess a population<lb break="yes"/>of 35,000, 67,000, 70,000, and<lb break="yes"/>135,000. The central table-land<lb break="yes"/>from La Puebla to Mexico, and<lb break="yes"/>from thence to Salamanca and Ze-<lb break="no" />laya, is covered with villages and<lb break="yes"/>hamlets like the most cultivated<lb break="yes"/>parts of Lombardy. To the east<lb break="yes" />and west of this narrow stripe,<lb break="yes"/>succeed tracts of uncultivated<lb break="yes"/>ground, on which cannot be found<lb break="yes" />ten or twelve persons to the<lb break="yes"/>square league. The capital and<lb break="yes"/>several other cities have scientific<lb break="yes" />establishments, which will bear<lb break="yes"/>a comparison with those of Eu-<lb break="no"/>rope. The architecture of the<lb break="yes"/>public and private edifices, the<lb break="yes"/>elegance of the furniture, the e-<lb break="no"/>quipages, the luxury and dress<lb break="yes"/>of the women, the tone of socie-<lb break="no"/>ty, all announce a refinement to<lb break="yes" />which the nakedness, ignorance,<lb break="yes"/>and vulgarity of the lower peo-<lb break="no"/>ple form the most striking con-<lb break="no"/>
                    <cb/>trast. This immense inequality<lb break="yes"/>of fortune does not only exist a-<lb break="no"/>mong the cast of whites, (Euro-<lb break="no"/>peans or Creoles,) it is even dis-<lb break="no"/>coverable among the Indians.</p>

                <p>The Mexican Indians, when<lb break="yes"/>we consider them <hi rendition="#i">en masse</hi>, offer<lb break="yes"/>a picture of extreme misery.<lb break="yes"/>Banished into the most barren<lb break="yes"/>districts, and indolent from na-<lb break="no"/>ture, and more still from their<lb break="yes" />political situation, the natives live<lb break="yes"/>only from hand to mouth. We<lb break="yes"/>should seek almost in vain a-<lb break="no"/>mong them for individuals who<lb break="yes"/>enjoy any thing like a certain<lb break="yes"/>mediocrity of fortune. Instead,<lb break="yes"/>however, of a comfortable inde-<lb break="no"/>pendency, we find a few families<lb break="yes" />whose fortune appears so much<lb break="yes"/>the more colossal, as we least<lb break="yes"/>expect it among the lowest class<lb break="yes"/>of the people. In the intendan-<lb break="no"/>cies of Oaxaca and Valladolid, in<lb break="yes"/>the valley of Toluca, and especi-<lb break="no"/>ally in the environs of the great<lb break="yes"/>city of la Puebla de los Angeles,<lb break="yes"/>we find several Indians, who un-<lb break="no"/>der an appearance of poverty con-<lb break="no"/>ceal considerable wealth. When<lb break="yes"/>I visited the small city of Cholu-<lb break="no"/>la, an old Indian woman was bu-<lb break="no"/>ried there, who left to her chil-<lb break="no"/>dren plantations of <hi rendition="#i">maguey</hi> (agave)<lb break="yes"/>worth more than 360,000 francs.<note place="foot" n="*">15,0001. sterling. <hi rendition="#i">Trans.</hi>

                    <lb break="yes"/>These plantations are the vine-<lb break="no"/>yards and sole wealth of the<lb break="yes"/>country. However, there are<lb break="yes"/>no caciques at Cholula; and the<lb break="yes"/>Indians there are all tributary,<lb break="yes"/>and distinguished for their great<lb break="yes"/>sobriety, and their gentle and<lb break="yes"/>peaceable manners. The man-<lb break="no"/>ners of the Cholulans exhibit a<lb break="yes"/>singular contrast to those of their<lb break="yes"/>neighbours of Tlascala, of whom<lb break="yes"/>

Among the most weal-<lb break="no"/>thy Indian families at Cholula<lb break="yes"/>are the Axcotlan, the Sarmien-<lb break="no"/>tos and Romeros; at Guaxocingo,<lb break="yes"/>the Sochipiltecatl; and especially<lb break="yes"/>the Tecuanouegues in the village<lb break="yes"/>de los Reyes.

                <p>The respect with which the<lb break="yes"/>pretended Inca had inspired the<lb break="yes"/>natives was so great, that, not-<lb break="no"/>withstanding their fear of the<lb break="yes"/>Spaniards, and though they were<lb break="yes" />surrounded by the soldiers of the<lb break="yes"/>victorious army, they prostrated<lb break="yes"/>
                    <cb/>themselves at the sight of the last<lb break="yes"/>of the children of the sun, as he<lb break="yes"/>passed along the streets to the<lb break="yes"/>place of execution.

When<lb break="yes"/>the chief fell into the hands of<lb break="yes"/>the Spaniards, <persName key="tupacamaru_dc">Diego</persName> surrender-<lb break="no"/>ed himself voluntarily, to profit<lb break="yes"/>by the pardon promised him in<lb break="yes"/>the name of the king.

The greater part of these<lb break="yes"/>roots is cultivated on the chi-<lb break="no"/>nampas, called by the Europe-<lb break="no"/>ans floating gardens. There are<lb break="yes"/>two sorts of them, of which the<lb break="yes"/>one is moveable, and driven<lb break="yes"/>about by the winds, and the other<lb break="yes"/>fixed and attached to the shore.<lb break="yes" />The first alone merit the deno-<lb break="no"/>mination of floating gardens, but<lb break="yes"/>their number is daily diminishing.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The ingenious invention of<lb break="yes"/>chinampas appears to go back to<lb break="yes"/>the end of the 14th century. It<lb break="yes"/>had its origin in the extraordina-<lb break="no"/>ry situation of a people surroun-<lb break="no"/>ded with enemies, and compelled<lb break="yes"/>to live in the midst of a lake<lb break="yes"/>little abounding in fish, who were<lb break="yes"/>forced to fall upon every means<lb break="yes"/>of procuring subsistence. It is<lb break="yes"/>even probable that nature herself<lb break="yes"/>suggested to the Aztecs the first<lb break="yes"/>idea of floating gardens. On the<lb break="yes"/>marshy banks of the lakes of Xo-<lb break="no"/>chimilco and Chalco, the agitated<lb break="yes"/>water in the time of the great<lb break="yes"/>rises carries away pieces of earth<lb break="yes"/>covered with herbs, and bound<lb break="yes"/>together by roots. These, float-<lb break="no"/>ing about for a long time as they<lb break="yes"/>are driven by the wind, some-<lb break="no"/>times unite into small islands.<lb break="yes"/>A tribe of men, too weak to de-<lb break="no" />fend themselves on the conti-<lb break="no"/>nent, would take advantage of<lb break="yes"/>these portions of ground which<lb break="yes"/>accident put within their reach,<lb break="yes"/>and of which no enemy disputed<lb break="yes"/>the property. The oldest chi-<lb break="no"/>nampas were merely bits of<lb break="yes"/>ground joined together artificial-<lb break="no"/>ly, and dug and sown upon by<lb break="yes"/>the Aztecs. These floating is-<lb break="no"/>lands are to be met with in all<lb break="yes"/>the zones. I have seen them<lb break="yes"/>in the kingdom of Quito, on<lb break="yes"/>

                <p>Simple lumps of earth, car-<lb break="no"/>ried away from the banks, have<lb break="yes"/>given rise to the invention of<lb break="yes"/>chinampas; but the industry of<lb break="yes"/>the Aztec nation gradually car-<lb break="no" />ried this system of cultivation to<lb break="yes"/>perfection. The floating gar-<lb break="no"/>dens, of which very many were<lb break="yes"/>found by the Spaniards, and of<lb break="yes"/>which many still exist in the lake<lb break="yes"/>of Chalco, were rafts formed of<lb break="yes"/>reeds, (totora,) rushes, roots, and<lb break="yes"/>branches of brushwood. The<lb break="yes"/>Indians cover these light and well<lb break="yes"/>connected materials with black<lb break="yes"/>mould, naturally impregnated<lb break="yes" />with muriate of soda. The soil<lb break="yes"/>is gradually purified from this<lb break="yes"/>salt by washing it with the water<lb break="yes"/>of the lake; and the ground be-<lb break="no"/>comes so much the more fertile<lb break="yes"/>as this lixiviation is annually re-<lb break="no"/>peated.

                    <cb/>lake of Tezcuco, because this<lb break="yes"/>water, by no means at the point<lb break="yes"/>of its saturation, is still capable<lb break="yes"/>of dissolving salt as it filtrates<lb break="yes"/>through the mould. The chi-<lb break="no"/>nampas sometimes contain even<lb break="yes"/>the cottage of the Indian who<lb break="yes"/>acts as guard for a group of<lb break="yes"/>floating gardens.

We see this last class all<lb break="yes"/>along the canal de la Viga, in the<lb break="yes"/>marshy ground between the lake<lb break="yes"/>of Chalco and the lake of Tez-<lb break="no"/>cuco.

                <p>The situation of the capital of<lb break="yes"/>Mexico is so much the more dan-<lb break="no"/>gerous, that the difference of lev-<lb break="no"/>el between the surface of the<lb break="yes"/>lake of Tezcuco and the ground<lb break="yes"/>on which the houses are built is<lb break="yes"/>every year diminishing. This<lb break="yes"/>ground is a fixed plane, particu-<lb break="no"/>larly since all the streets of Mexi-<lb break="no"/>co were paved under the govern-<lb break="no"/>ment of the count <persName key="revillagigedo_jvgpdphyad">de Revillagi-<lb break="no"/>gedo</persName>; but the bed of the lake of<lb break="yes"/>Tezcuco is progressively rising<lb break="yes"/>from the mud brought down by<lb break="yes"/>the small torrents, which is de-<lb break="no"/>posited in the reservoirs into<lb break="yes"/>which they flow. To avoid a si-<lb break="no"/>milar inconvenience, the Vene-<lb break="no"/>tians turned from their Lagunas<lb break="yes"/>the Brenta, the Piave, the Liven-<lb break="no"/>za, and other rivers, which form-<lb break="no"/>ed deposits in them.<note place="foot" n="*">Andreossy on the canal of the<lb break="yes"/>South, p. 19</note> If we<lb break="yes"/>could rely on the results of a<lb break="yes"/>survey executed in the 16th cen-<lb break="no"/>tury, we should no doubt find<lb break="yes" />that the Plaza Mayor of Mexico<lb break="yes"/>

If, on<lb break="yes"/>the one hand, the humidity of the<lb break="yes"/>atmosphere and the sources have<lb break="yes"/>diminished in the mountains sur-<lb break="no"/>rounding the valley, from the<lb break="yes" />destruction of the forests; on<lb break="yes"/>the other hand, the cultivation of<lb break="yes"/>the land has increased the depo-<lb break="no"/>sitions and the rapidity of the<lb break="yes"/>inundations. General Andreossy,<lb break="yes"/>in his excellent work on the ca-<lb break="no"/>nal of Languedoc, has insisted a<lb break="yes"/>great deal on these causes, which<lb break="yes"/>are common to all climates. Wa-<lb break="no"/>ters which glide over declivities,<lb break="yes"/>covered with sward, carry much<lb break="yes" />less of the soil along with them<lb break="yes"/>than those which run over loose<lb break="yes"/>soil. Now the sward, whether<lb break="yes"/>formed from gramina, as in Eu-<lb break="no"/>rope, or small alpine plants, as in<lb break="yes"/>Mexico, is only to be preserved<lb break="yes"/>in the shade of a forest. The<lb break="yes"/>shrubs and underwood oppose al-<lb break="no"/>so powerful obstacles to the melt-<lb break="no"/>ed snow which runs down the de-<lb break="no"/>clivities of the mountains. When<lb break="yes"/>these declivities are stripped of<lb break="yes"/>their vegetation, the streams are<lb break="yes"/>less opposed, and more easily<lb break="yes"/>unite with the torrents which<lb break="yes"/>swell the lakes in the neighbour-<lb break="no" />hood of Mexico.</p>

                <p>It is natural enough, that in the<lb break="yes"/>order of hydraulical operations<lb break="yes"/>undertaken to preserve the capital<lb break="yes" />from the danger of inundation, the<lb break="yes"/>system of dikes preceded that of<lb break="yes"/>evacuating canals or drains.
