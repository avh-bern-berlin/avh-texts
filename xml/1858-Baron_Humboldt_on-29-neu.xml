                <p>&#x2014;The following,<lb/>from a letter addressed lately by Alexander von
                    Hum-<lb/>boldt to Julius Froebel, a German author of some dis-<lb/>tinction, and
                    formerly a member of the Parliament at<lb/>Frankfort, may not be without
                    interest to some of our<lb/>readers, partly from the question of slavery it
                    alludes to,<lb/>and partly from the noble image it exhibits of the un-<lb/>dying
                    earnestness of purpose in that &#x201C;old man
                    eloquent:&#x201D;<lb/>&#x2014;&#x201C;I should like to live long enough yet to
                    see your<lb/>book &#x2018;On the Political State of America,&#x2019; with
                    which<lb/>you are engaged. May you continue to brand that<lb/>shameful leaning
                    to slavery, and that imposture about<lb/>introducing negroes who are said to
                    become free, and<lb/>which is a means to encourage those negro hunts in
                    the<lb/>interior of Africa. What horrors one is obliged to wit-<lb/>ness, if one
                    has the misfortune of living from <choice>
                        <sic>1767</sic>
                        <corr type="editorial">1789</corr>
                    </choice> to<lb/>1858. My book against slavery has not been prohibited<lb/>in
                    Madrid, yet in the United States, which you call &#x2018;the<lb/>republic of
                    gentlemen,&#x2019; it could only become saleable by<lb/>the omission of all that
                    concerns the sufferings of coloured<lb/>people who, according to my political
                    views, are fellow-<lb break="hyph-yes"/>men entitled to enjoy any amount of
                    freedom. I lead<lb/>an industrious life, chiefly at night, being much
                    worried<lb/>by an ever-increasing and mostly uninteresting corres-<lb/>pondence.
                    I exist joylessly, in my eighty-ninth year,<lb/>since of so many things towards
                    which I have striven<lb/>ever since my early youth, and with ever equal
                    warmth,<lb/>so very little has been fulfilled.&#x201D;</p>
