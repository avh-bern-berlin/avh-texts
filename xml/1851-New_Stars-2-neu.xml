                    appear-<lb/>ance of strongly scintillating stars of the first magnitude,<lb/>is
                    an event in the regions of space of which the occur-<lb/>rence has ever excited
                    the astonishment of men. This<lb/>astonishment is so much the greater, as such
                    an event in<lb/>nature as the sudden visibility which, though
                    previously<lb/>unseen, we yet believe to have existed previously, is one
                    of<lb/>the rarest of all phenomena. In the course of the three<lb/>centuries
                    from 1500 to 1800, there have appeared to the<lb/>inhabitants of the northern
                    hemisphere 42 comets visible<lb/>to the naked eye&#x2014;being on an average 14
                    in a century;<lb/>while, during the same 300 years, only eight new stars
                    have<lb/>been observed. The rarity of the latter occurrence becomes<lb/>still
                    more striking when we embrace still longer periods.&#x2014;<lb/><hi
