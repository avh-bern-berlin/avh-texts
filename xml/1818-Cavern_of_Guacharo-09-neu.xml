                </head>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rendition="#k">In</hi> a country where the people love what is marvellous, a cavern<lb break="yes"/>that gives birth to a river, and is inhabited by thousands of nocturnal<lb break="yes"/>birds, the fat of which is employed in the Missions to dress food, is<lb break="yes"/>an everlasting object of conversation and discussion. Scarcely has a<lb break="yes"/>stranger arrived at Cumana, when he is told of the stone of Araya<lb break="yes"/>for the eyes; of the labourer of Arenas who suckled his child; and<lb break="yes"/>of the <hi rendition="#k">Cavern</hi> of <hi rendition="#k">Guacharo,</hi> which is said to be several leagues in<lb break="yes"/>length; till he is tired of hearing of them.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The Cueva del Guacharo is pierced in the vertical profile of a rock,<lb break="yes"/>The entrance is toward the south, and forms a vault eighty feet broad,<lb break="yes"/>and seventy-two feet high. The rock, that surmounts the grotto, is<lb break="yes"/>covered with trees of gigantic height. The mammee-tree, and the<lb break="yes"/>genipa with large and shining leaves, raise their branches vertically<lb break="yes"/>toward the sky; while those of the courbaril and the erythrina, form<lb break="yes"/>as they extend themselves, a thick vault of verdure. Plants of the<lb break="yes"/>family of pathos with succulent stems, oxalises, and orchide&#x00E6; of a<lb break="yes"/>singular structure, rise in the driest clefts of the rocks; while creep-<lb break="no" />ing plants, waving in the winds, are inter-woven in festoons before<lb break="yes"/>the opening of the cavern. We distinguished in these festoons a<lb break="yes"/>bignonia of a violet-blue, the purple dolichos, and for the first time<lb break="yes"/>that magnificent olandra, the orange flower of which has a fleshy<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="170" facs="#f0002"/>tube more than four inches long. The entrances of grottoes, like the<lb break="yes"/>view of cascades, derive their principal charm from the situation,<lb break="yes"/>more or less majestic, in which they are placed, and which in some<lb break="yes"/>sort determines the character of the landscape. What a contrast be-<lb break="no"/>tween the Cueva of Caripe, and those caverns of the North crowned<lb break="yes"/>with oaks and gloomy larch-trees!</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>But this luxury of vegetation embellishes not only the outside of<lb break="yes" />the vault, but appears even in the vestibule of the grotto. We saw<lb break="yes"/>with astonishment plaintain-leaved heliconias eighteen feet high, the<lb break="yes"/>praga palm-tree, and arborescent arums, follow the banks of the river<lb break="yes"/>even to those subterranean places. The vegetation continues in the<lb break="yes"/>Cave of Caripe, as in those deep crevices of the Andes, half exclu-<lb break="no"/>ded from the light of day; and does not disappear, till, advancing in<lb break="yes"/>the interior, we reach thirty or forty paces from the entrance. We<lb break="yes"/>measured the way by means of a cord: and we went on about four<lb break="yes"/>hundred and thirty feet, without being obliged to light our torches.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Day-light penetrates into this region, because the grotto forms but<lb break="yes"/>one single channel, which keeps the same direction from south-east to<lb break="yes"/>north-west. Where the light begins to fail, we heard from afar the<lb break="yes"/>hoarse sounds of the nocturnal birds, sounds which the natives think<lb break="yes"/>belong exclusively to those subterraneous places. The guacharo is<lb break="yes"/>of the size of our fowls, has the mouth of the goatsuckers and<lb break="yes"/>procnias, and the port of those vultures, the crooked beak of which<lb break="yes"/>is surrounded with stiff silky hairs. It forms a new genus, very dif-<lb break="no"/>ferent from the goatsucker by the force of its voice, by the consider-<lb break="no"/>able strength of its beak, containing a double tooth, by its feet with-<lb break="no" />out the membranes that unite the anterior phalanxes of the claws. In<lb break="yes"/>its manners it has analogies both with the goatsuckers and the alpine<lb break="yes"/>crow. The plumage of the guacharo is of a dark bluish-gray, mixed<lb break="yes"/>with small streaks and specks of black. It is difficult to form an<lb break="yes"/>idea of the horrible noise occasioned by thousands of these birds in<lb break="yes"/>the dark part of the cavern, and which can only be compared to the<lb break="yes"/>croaking of our crows, which, in the pine forests of the north, live in<lb break="yes"/>society, and construct their nests upon trees, the tops of which touch<lb break="yes"/>each other. The shrill and piercing cries of the guacharoes strike<lb break="yes"/>upon the vaults of the rocks, and are repeated by the echo in the<lb break="yes"/>depth of the cavern. The Indians showed us the nests of these birds,<lb break="yes" />by fixing torches to the end of a long pole. These nests were fifty or<lb break="yes"/>sixty feet high above our heads, in holes in the shape of funnels, with<lb break="yes"/>which the roof of the grotto is pierced like a sieve. The noise in-<lb break="no"/>
                    <pb n="171" facs="#f0003"/>creased as we advanced, and the birds were affrighted by the light of<lb break="yes"/>the torches of copal. When this noise ceased around us, we heard,<lb break="yes"/>at a distance, the plaintive cries of the birds roosting in other ramifi-<lb break="no"/>cations of the cavern. It seemed as if these bands answered each<lb break="yes"/>other alternately.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The Indians enter into the Cueva del Guacharo once a year, near<lb break="yes" />Midsummer, armed with poles, by means of which they destroy the<lb break="yes" />greater part of the nests. At this season, several thousands of birds<lb break="yes"/>are killed; and the old ones, to defend their brood, hover around the<lb break="yes"/>heads of the savage Indians, uttering terrible cries, which would appal<lb break="yes"/>any heart but that of a man in an untutored state.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>We followed, as we continued our progress through the cavern, the<lb break="yes" />banks of the small river which issued from it, and is from twenty-<lb break="no"/>eight to thirty feet wide. We walked on the banks, as far as the hills<lb break="yes"/>formed of calcareous incrustations permitted us. When the torrent<lb break="yes"/>winds among very high masses of stalactites, we were often obliged<lb break="yes"/>to descend into its bed, which is only two feet in depth. We learnt,<lb break="yes"/>with surprise, that this subterraneous rivulet is the origin of the river<lb break="yes"/>Caripe, which, at a few leagues distance, after having joined the small<lb break="yes"/>river of Santa Maria, is navigable for canoes. It enters into the ri-<lb break="no"/>ver Areo, under the name of <hi rendition="#i">Canno de Terezen.</hi> We found, on the<lb break="yes"/>banks of the subterraneous rivulet, a great quantity of palm-tree wood,<lb break="yes"/>the remains of trunks, on which the Indians climb to reach the nests<lb break="yes"/>hanging to the roofs of the cavern. The rings, formed by the ves-<lb break="no"/>tiges of the old footstalks of the leaves, furnish, as it were, the foot-<lb break="no"/>steps of a ladder perpendicularly placed.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The Grotto of Caripe preserves the same breadth, and its primi-<lb break="no" />tive height of sixty or seventy feet, to the distance of 1458 feet, ac-<lb break="no"/>curately measured. I have never seen a cavern, in either continent,<lb break="yes"/>of so uniform and regular a construction. We had great difficulty in<lb break="yes"/>persuading the Indians to pass beyond the outer part of the grotto,<lb break="yes"/>the only part which they annually visit to collect the fat. The whole<lb break="yes"/>authority of <hi rendition="#i">los padres</hi> was necessary, to induce them to advance as<lb break="yes"/>far as the spot where the soil rises abruptly at an inclination of sixty<lb break="yes"/>degrees, and where the torrent forms a small subterraneous cascade.<lb break="yes"/>The natives connect mystic ideas with this cave, inhabited by noctur-<lb break="no"/>nal birds; they believe, that the souls of their ancestors sojourn in the<lb break="yes"/>deep recesses of the cavern. &#x201C;Man,&#x201D; say they, &#x201C;should avoid places<lb break="yes"/>which are enlightened neither by the Sun nor by the Moon.&#x201D; To go<lb break="yes"/>and join the guacharoes, is to join their fathers,&#x2014;is to die. The ma-<lb break="no"/>
                    <pb n="172" facs="#f0004"/>gicians and the poisoners perform their nocturnal tricks at the en-<lb break="no"/>trance of the cavern, to conjure the chief of the evil spirits.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>At the point where the river forms the subterraneous cascade, a hill<lb break="yes"/>covered with vegetation, which is opposite the opening of the grotto,<lb break="yes"/>presents itself in a very picturesque manner. It appears, at the ex-<lb break="no"/>tremity of a straight passage, 240 toises in length. The stalactites,<lb break="yes"/>which descend from the vault, and which resemble colums suspended<lb break="yes"/>in the air, display themselves on a back-ground of verdure. The<lb break="yes"/>opening of the cavern appeared singularly contracted, when we saw<lb break="yes"/>it about the middle of the day, illumined by the vivid light reflected<lb break="yes"/>at once from the sky, the plants, and the rocks. The distant light of<lb break="yes"/>day formed somewhat of magical contrast with the darkness that sur-<lb break="no"/>rounded us in those vast caverns. We climbed, not without some<lb break="yes" />difficulty, the small hill, whence the subterraneous rivulet descends.<lb break="yes"/>We saw that the grotto was perceptibly contracted, retaining only forty<lb break="yes"/>feet in height; and that it continued stretching to the northeast, without<lb break="yes"/>deviating from its primitive direction, which is parallel to that of the<lb break="yes"/>great valley of Caripe.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The missionaries, with all their authority, could not prevail on the<lb break="yes"/>Indians to penetrate farther into the cavern. As the vault grew low-<lb break="no"/>er, the cries of the guacharoes became more shrill. We were obliged<lb break="yes"/>to yield to the pusillanimity of our guides, and trace back our steps.<lb break="yes"/>We followed the course of the torrent to go out of the cavern. Be-<lb break="no"/>fore our eyes were dazzled with the light of day, we saw, without the<lb break="yes"/>grotto, the water of the river sparkling amid the foliage of the trees<lb break="yes"/>that concealed it. It was like a picture placed in the distance, and to<lb break="yes"/>which the mouth of the cavern served as a frame. Having at length<lb break="yes"/>reached the entrance, and seated ourselves on the bank of the rivulet,<lb break="yes" />we rested after our fatigues. We were glad to be beyond the hoarse<lb break="yes"/>cries of the birds, and to leave a place where darkness does not offer<lb break="yes"/>even the charm of silence and tranquillity.</p>
