<p>The following testimonial from a distinguished man and a scholar<lb/>ought to excite feelings of
                admiration and regard towards Col. Fremont.</p><lb/><div n="1"><head><hi rendition="#b">LETTER FROM BARON HUMBOLDT.</hi></head><lb/><p>&#x201C;To COL. FREMONT, <hi rendition="#k">Senator:</hi>&#x2014;It is very agreable to me, sir,
                    to address you<lb/>these lines by my excellent friend our minister to the United
                    States, <choice>

                    </choice>. de Gerold af-<lb/>ter having given you, in the new edition of my
                    &#x201C;Aspects of nature,&#x201D; the public testi-<lb/>mony of the admiration
                    which is due to your gigantic labors between St. Louis, of<lb/>Missouri, and the
                    coasts of the South Sea, I feel happy to offer you, in this little token<lb/>of
                    my existence (<hi rendition="#i">dans ce petit signe de vie</hi>), the homage of
                    my warm acknowledgement.<lb/>You have displayed a noble courage in distant
                    expeditions, braved all the dangers of<lb/>cold and famine, enriched all the
                    branches of the natural sciences, illustrated a vast<lb/>country which was
                    almost entirely unknown to us.</p><lb/><p>A merit so rare has been acknowledged by a sovereign warmly interested in the<lb/>progress of
                    physical geography; the king orders me to offer you the grand golden med-<lb/>al
                    destined to those who have labored at scientific progress. I hope that this mark
                    of<lb/>the Royal good will, will be agreeable to you at a time when, upon the
                    proposition of<lb/>the illustrious geographer, Chas. Ritter, the Geographical
                    Society at Berlin has named<lb/>you an honorary member. For myself, I must thank
                    you particularly also for the hon-<lb/>or which you have done in attaching my
                    name and that of my fellow-laborer and inti-<lb/>mate friend, Mr. Bonpland, to
                    countries neighboring to those which have been the ob-<lb/>ject of our labors.

                        of Slavery, will<lb/>be worthily represented by a friend of liberty and of
