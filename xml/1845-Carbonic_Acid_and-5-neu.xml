    <div n="1"><head><hi rendition="#k">ORIGIN OF VOLCANOES.</hi></head><lb/><p><hi rendition="#k">If</hi>, in many languages, Volcanoes are properly designated burn-<lb/>ing mountains, it would still be a great mistake to suppose that they<lb/>were produced by any gradual accumulation of the streams of lava<lb/>that have flowed from them: their origin appears to be much more<lb/>generally the consequence of a sudden upheaval of tenacious masses<lb/>of trachyte or augitic rock, including polychromatic [Labrador] <choice><sic>fel</sic><corr type="editorial">fels</corr></choice>-<lb/>par. The measure of the upheaving force reveals itself in the heights<lb/>of the volcano; and this is so different, that in one case it is a mere<lb/>hillock (as in Cosima, one of the Japanese Kuriles); in another, it is<lb/>a cone that rises to an elevation of 18,000 feet. It has seemed to me<lb/>as if the relative height had a great influence upon the frequency of<lb/>the eruptions; as if these were much more common in the lower than<lb/>the loftier volcanoes. I will call attention to the following series: &#x2014;<lb/>Stromboli (2175 feet high), Gucamayo, in the province of Quiros,<lb/>which thunders almost every day (I have frequently heard it in Chilo,<lb/>near Quito, at a distance of 22 German miles), Vesuvius (3637 feet<lb/>high), &#x00C6;tna (10,200 feet high), the Peak of Teneriffe (11,424 feet<lb/>high), and Cotopaxi (17,892 feet high). If the focus of these seve-<lb/>ral volcanoes be at the same depth helow the surface, a greater force<lb/>will be required to raise the molten masses to a six or eight times<lb/>higher level. Whilst the low Stromboli (Strongyle) has laboured in-<lb/>cessantly, at least since the times of the Homeric traditions, and<lb/>serves as a light-house to the Tyrrhenian Sea, guiding the seaman with<lb/>its fiery signal on his course, the more lofty volcanoes are character-<lb/>ized by lengthened periods of repose. The eruptions of the greater<lb/>number of the colossal Volcanoes that crown the Andes occur at in-<lb/>tervals almost of a century apart. &#x2014; <hi rendition="#i">From Baron Humboldt&#x2019;s Kosmos.</hi></p></div><lb/><milestone unit="section" rendition="#hr"/><lb/>
