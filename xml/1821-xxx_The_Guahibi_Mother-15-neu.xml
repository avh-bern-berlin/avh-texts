                    there is a granite hummock that rises on<lb break="yes"/>the western bank, near

                            >Guasacavi</corr></choice>,<lb break="yes"/>it is called the Rock of the
                    Guahiba Woman, or the<lb break="yes"/>Rock of the Mother, <hi rendition="#i"
                        >Piedra de la Madre.</hi> This name<lb break="yes"/>was given to it from a
                    singular event, which is re-<lb break="no"/>lated by Humboldt, in his
                    &#x201C;Travels to the Equinoctial<lb break="yes"/>Regions of the New
                    Continent.&#x201D;</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>&#x201C;If,&#x201D; says this enterprising traveller, &#x201C;in these<lb
                        break="yes"/>solitary scenes, man scarcely leaves behind him any<lb
                        break="yes"/>trace of his existence, it is doubly humiliating for a<lb
                        break="yes"/>European to see perpetuated by the name of a rock,<lb
                        break="yes"/>by one of those imperishable monuments of nature,<lb
                        break="yes"/>the remembrance of the moral degradation of our<lb break="yes"
                    />species, and the contrast between the virtue of a<lb break="yes"/>savage, and
                    the barbarism of civilized man!</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>&#x201C;In 1797, the missionary of San Fernando had<lb break="yes"/>led his
                    Indians to the mouth of the Rio Guaviare,<lb break="yes"/>on one of those
                    hostile incursions, which are prohi-<lb break="no"/>bited alike by religion and
                    the Spanish laws. They<lb break="yes"/>found in an
                            <choice><sic>Italian</sic><corr type="editorial">Indian</corr></choice>
                    hut, a Guahiba mother with three<lb break="yes"/>children, two of whom were
                    still infants. They<lb break="yes"/>were occupied in preparing the flour of
                        Cassava.<lb break="yes"/>Resistance was impossible; the father was gone
                        to<lb break="yes"/>fish, and the mother tried in vain to flee with her<lb
                        break="yes"/>children. Scarcely had she reached the savannah,<lb break="yes"
                    />when she was seized by the Indians of the mission,<lb break="yes"/>who go to
                        <hi rendition="#i">hunt men,</hi> like the Whites and the Negroes<lb
                        break="yes"/>in Africa. The mother and her children were<lb break="yes"
                    />found, and dragged to the bank of the river. The<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="41" facs="#f0002"/> monk, seated in his boat, waited the issue of an
                        ex-<lb break="no"/>pedition, of which he partook not the danger. Had<lb
                        break="yes"/>the mother made too violent a resistance, the Indians<lb
                        break="yes"/>would have killed her, for every thing is permitted<lb
                        break="yes"/>when they go to the conquest of souls (<hi rendition="#i">à la
                            conquista<lb break="yes"/>espiritual</hi>), and it is children in
                    particular they seek<lb break="yes"/>to capture, in order to treat them, in the
                    mission, as<lb break="yes"/>
                    <hi rendition="#i">poitos,</hi> or slaves of the Christians. The prisoners<lb
                        break="yes"/>were carried to San Fernando, in the hope that the<lb
                        break="yes"/>mother would be unable to find her way back to her<lb
                        break="yes"/>home, by land. Far from those children who had<lb break="yes"
                    />accompanied their father on the day on which she<lb break="yes"/>had been
                    carried off, this unhappy woman showed<lb break="yes"/>signs of the deepest
                    despair. She attempted to take<lb break="yes"/>back to her family the children
                    who had been<lb break="yes"/>snatched away by the missionary, and fled with
                        them<lb break="yes"/>repeatedly from the village of San Fernando, but<lb
                        break="yes"/>the Indians never failed to seize her anew; and the<lb
                        break="yes"/>missionary, after having caused her to be mercilessly<lb
                        break="yes"/>beaten, took the cruel resolution of separating the<lb
                        break="yes"/>mother from the two children who had been carried<lb
                        break="yes"/>off with her. She was conveyed alone toward the<lb break="yes"
                    />missions of the Rio Negro, going up to the Atabapo.<lb break="yes"/>Slightly
                    bound, she was seated at the bow of the<lb break="yes"/>boat, ignorant of the
                    fate that awaited her; but she<lb break="yes"/>judged, by the direction of the
                    sun, that she was<lb break="yes"/>removed farther and farther from her hut and
                        her<lb break="yes"/>native country. She succeeded in breaking her<lb
                        break="yes"/>bonds, threw herself into the water, and swam to the<lb
                        break="yes"/>left bank of the Atabapo. The current carried her to a<lb
                        break="yes"/>shelf of rock, which bears her name to this day. She<lb
                        break="yes"/>landed, and took shelter in the woods; but the presi-<lb
                        break="no"/>dent of the missions ordered the Indians to row to<lb
                        break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="42" facs="#f0003"/> the shore, and follow the traces of the Guahiba.
                        In<lb break="yes"/>the evening, she was brought back. Stretched upon<lb
                        break="yes"/>the rock, <hi rendition="#i">la Piedra de la Madre,</hi> a
                    cruel punishment<lb break="yes"/>was inflicted on her with those straps of
                        manatee<lb break="yes"/>leather, which serve for whips in that country,
                        and<lb break="yes"/>with which the alcades are always furnished. This<lb
                        break="yes"/>unhappy woman, her hands tied behiud her back<lb break="yes"
                    />with strong stalks of <hi rendition="#i">mavacure,</hi> was then dragged to<lb
                        break="yes"/>the mission of Javita.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>&#x201C;She was there thrown into one of the caravan-<lb break="no"/>seras, that
                    are called <hi rendition="#i">Casa del Rey.</hi> It was the rainy<lb break="yes"
                    />season, and night was profoundly dark. Forests,<lb break="yes"/>till then
                    believed to be impenetrable, separated the<lb break="yes"/>mission of Javita
                    from that of San Fernando, which<lb break="yes"/>was twenty-five leagues distant
                    in a straight line.<lb break="yes"/>No other part is known than that of the
                    rivers; no<lb break="yes"/>man ever attempted to go by land from one village<lb
                        break="yes"/>to another, were they only a few leagues apart.<lb break="yes"
                    />But such difficulties do not stop a mother, who is<lb break="yes"/>separated
                    from her children. Her children are at<lb break="yes"/>San Fernando de Atabapo;
                    she must find them<lb break="yes"/>again, she must execute her project of
                        delivering<lb break="yes"/>them from the hands of the Christians, of
                        bringing<lb break="yes"/>them back to their father on the banks of the<lb
                        break="yes"/>Guaviare. The Guahiba was carelessly guarded in<lb break="yes"
                    />the caravansera. Her arms being wounded, the<lb break="yes"/>Indians of Javita
                    had loosened her bonds, unknown<lb break="yes"/>to the missionary and the
                    alcades. She succeeded,<lb break="yes"/>by the help of her teeth, in breaking
                    them entirely;<lb break="yes"/>disappeared during the night; and at the fourth
                        rising<lb break="yes"/>sun, was seen at the mission of San Fernando,<lb
                        break="yes"/>hovering around the hut where her children were<lb break="yes"
                    />confined. &#x2018;What the woman performed,&#x2019; added<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="43" facs="#f0004"/> the missionary, who gave us this sad narrative,
                        &#x2018;the<lb break="yes"/>most robust Indian would not have ventured to<lb
                        break="yes"/>undertake. She traversed the woods at a season<lb break="yes"
                    />when the sky is constantly covered with clouds, and<lb break="yes"/>the sun,

                    of the waters direct her<lb break="yes"/>way? The inundations of the rivers
                    forced her to<lb break="yes"/>go far from the banks of the main stream,
                        through<lb break="yes"/>the midst of woods, where the movement of the<lb
                        break="yes"/>waters is almost imperceptible. How often must<lb break="yes"

                    network around the trunks they entwine?<lb break="yes"/>How often must she have
                    swam across the rivulets<lb break="yes"/>that run into the Atabapo? This
                    unfortunate woman<lb break="yes"/>was asked how she had sustained herself during
                        the<lb break="yes"/>four days? She said, &#x2018;That, exhausted with
                        fatigue,<lb break="yes"/>she could find no other nourishment than those
                        great<lb break="yes"/>black ants called <hi rendition="#i">vachacos,</hi>
                    which climb the trees in<lb break="yes"/>long bands, to suspend on them their
                    resinous nests.&#x2019; &#x2019;<lb break="yes"/>We pressed the missionary to
                    tell us, whether the<lb break="yes"/>Guahiba had peacefully enjoyed the
                    happiness of<lb break="yes"/>remaining with her children; and if any
                        repentance<lb break="yes"/>had followed this excess of cruelty. He would
                        not<lb break="yes"/>satisfy our curiosity; but at our return from the Rio<lb
                        break="yes"/>Negro, we learnt that the Indian mother was not<lb break="yes"
