                <p>In 1797, the missionary of San Fernando had led his In-<lb break="no"/>dians to the banks of the Rio Guaviare, on one of those hostile<lb break="yes" />incursions, which are prohibited alike by religion and the<lb break="yes" />Spanish laws. They found in an Indian hut a Guahiba<lb break="yes"/>mother with three children, two of whom were still infants.<lb break="yes"/>They were occupied in preparing the flour of cassava. Re-<lb break="no"/>sistance was impossible; the father was gone to fish, and<lb break="yes"/>the mother tried in vain to flee with her children. Scarcely<lb break="yes"/>had she reached the savannah, when she was seized by the<lb break="yes"/>Indians of the mission, who go to <hi rendition="#i">hunt men,</hi> like the Whites<lb break="yes"/>and the Negroes in Africa. The mother and her children<lb break="yes"/>were bound, and dragged to the bank of the river. The<lb break="yes"/>monk, seated in his boat, waited the issue of an expedition,<lb break="yes"/>of which he partook not the danger. Had the mother<lb break="yes"/>made too violent a resistance, the Indians would have killed<lb break="yes"/>her, for every thing is permitted when they go to the con-<lb break="no"/>quest of souls; and it is children in particular they seek to<lb break="yes"/>capture, in order to treat them in the mission as slaves<lb break="yes"/>of the Christians. The prisoners were carried to San<lb break="yes"/>Fernando in the hope that the mother would be unable to<lb break="yes"/>find her way back to her home by land. Far from those<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="16" facs="#f0002"/> children who had accompanied their father on the day in<lb break="yes"/>which she had been carried off, this unhappy woman show-<lb break="no"/>ed signs of the deepest despair. She attempted to take back<lb break="yes"/>to her family the children, who had been snatched away by<lb break="yes"/>the missionary; and fled with them repeatedly from the vil-<lb break="no"/>lage of San Fernando, but the Indians never failed to seize<lb break="yes"/>her anew; and the missionary, after having caused her to<lb break="yes"/>be mercilessly beaten, took the cruel resolution of separating<lb break="yes"/>the mother from the two children, who had been carried off<lb break="yes"/>with her. She was conveyed alone toward the missions of<lb break="yes"/>the Rio Negro, going up the Atabapo. Slightly bound, she<lb break="yes"/>was seated at the bow of the boat, ignorant of the fate that<lb break="yes"/>awaited her; but she judged by the direction of the sun,<lb break="yes"/>that she was removing farther and farther from her hut and<lb break="yes"/>her native country. She succeeded in breaking her bonds,<lb break="yes"/>threw herself into the water, and swam to the left bank of<lb break="yes"/>the Atabapo. The current carried her to a shelf of a rock,<lb break="yes"/>which bears her name to this day. She landed, and took<lb break="yes"/>shelter in the woods; but the president of the missions or-<lb break="no"/>dered the Indians to row to the shore, and follow the traces<lb break="yes"/>of the Guahiba. In the evening she was brought back, and<lb break="yes"/>a cruel punishment was inflicted on her. This unhappy<lb break="yes"/>woman, her hands tied behind her back with strong stalks<lb break="yes"/>of <hi rendition="#i">mavacure,</hi> was then dragged to the mission of Javita.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>She was there thrown into one of the caravanseras that<lb break="yes"/>are called
                        <hi rendition="#i">Casa del Rey.</hi> It was the rainy season, and the<lb
                        break="yes"/>night was profoundly dark. Forests, till then believed to be<lb
                        break="yes"/>impenetrable, separated the mission of Javita from that of<lb
                        break="yes"/>San Fernando, which was twenty-five leagues distant in a<lb
                        break="yes"/>straight line. No other path is known than that of the<lb
                        break="yes"/>rivers; no man ever attempted to go by land from one vil-<lb
                        break="no"/>lage to another, were they only a few leagues apart. But<lb
                        break="yes"/>such difficulties do not stop a mother who is separated from<lb
                        break="yes"/>her children. The Guahiba was carelessly guarded in the<lb
                        break="yes"/>caravansera. Her arms being wounded, the Indians of Ja-<lb
                        break="no"/>vita had loosened her bonds, unknown to the missionary and<lb
                        break="yes"/>the alcades. She succeeded by the help of her teeth in<lb
                        break="yes"/>breaking them entirely; disappeared during the night; and<lb
                        break="yes"/>at the fourth rising sun was seen at the mission of San Fer-<lb
                        break="no"/>nando, hovering around the hut where her children were<lb
                        break="yes"/>confined. &#x201C;What that woman performed,&#x201D; added the
                        mis-<lb break="no"/>sionary who gave us this sad narrative, &#x201C;the most
                        robust<lb break="yes"/>Indian would not have ventured to undertake. She
                        traversed<lb break="yes"/>the woods at a season when the sky is constantly
                        covered<lb break="yes"/>with clouds, and the sun, during whole days, appears
                        but<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="17" facs="#f0003"/> for a few minutes. Did the course of the waters
                        direct<lb break="yes"/>her way? The inundations of the rivers forced her to
                        go<lb break="yes"/>far from the banks of the main stream, through the
                        midst<lb break="yes"/>of woods where the movement of the waters is almost
                        im-<lb break="no"/>perceptible. How often must she have been stopped by
                        the<lb break="yes"/>thorny lianas, that form a network around the trunks
                        they<lb break="yes"/>entwine! How often must she have swum across the
                        rivu-<lb break="no"/>lets that run into the Atabapo! This unfortunate
                        woman<lb break="yes"/>was asked how she had sustained herself during four
                        days?<lb break="yes"/>She said that, exhausted with fatigue, she could find
                        no<lb break="yes"/>other nourishment than those great black ants called <hi
                        rendition="#i">vacha-<lb break="no"/>cos,</hi> which climb the trees in long
                    bands, to suspend on<lb break="yes"/>them their resinous nests.&#x201D; We
                    pressed the missionary to<lb break="yes"/>tell us whether the Guahiba had
                    peacefully enjoyed the hap-<lb break="no"/>piness of remaining with her
                    children; and if any repentance<lb break="yes"/>had followed this excess of
                    cruelty. He would not satisfy<lb break="yes"/>our curiosity; but at our return
                    from the Rio Negro we<lb break="yes"/>learnt that the Indian mother was not
                    allowed time to cure<lb break="yes"/>her wounds, but was again separated from
                    her children, and<lb break="yes"/>sent to one of the missions of the Upper
                    Oroonoko. There<lb break="yes"/>she died, refusing all kind of nourishment, as
                    the savages<lb break="yes"/>do in great ealamities.</p>
