<div n="1"><head><hi rendition="#k">Baron Humboldt and Colonel Fremont.</hi></head><p>&#x2014;The present elec-<lb/>tioneering contest in the United States for a President has given a New<lb/>York paper an opportunity of publishing a very interesting letter from<lb/>Baron Humboldt. In the year 1850 the Prussian government awarded<lb/>Col. Fremont the great gold medal for his efforts in the advancement<lb/>of science, and in transmitting it, the great German naturalist enhanced<lb/>its value by sending with it a document, in which he says&#x2014;&#x201C;I feel<lb/>happy in being able once more to give you the assurance of my warm<lb/>recognition. In your distant expeditions you displayed a noble forti-<lb/>tude, braved every danger of cold and hunger, enriched every branch<lb/>of natural science, and opened for us a great region that was previously<lb/>almost unknown to us. I must especially thank you for the honour<lb/>you confer upon me by having bestowed the names of myself, as well<lb/>as of my fellow-explorer and friend Bonpland, on regions that border<lb/>on those which formed the object of our scientific labours. California,<lb/>that has so magnanimously withstood the introduction of slavery, will<lb/>be worthily represented by a friend to freedom and to the progress of<lb/>science.&#x201D;</p></div><lb/></body><back></back>
