                    <hi rendition="#k">The</hi> following affecting story is told by Hum-<lb break="no"/>boldt:&#x2014;Where the Atabapo enters the Rio<lb break="yes" />Temi, but before we reached its confluence, a<lb break="yes"/>granitic hummock, that rises on the western<lb break="yes"/>bank, near the mouth of the Guasacavi, is called<lb break="yes"/>the rock of the Guahibi Woman, or the rock of<lb break="yes"/>the Mother Piedra de la Madre. We inquired<lb break="yes" />the cause of so singular a denomination. Father<lb break="yes"/>Zea could not satisfy our curiosity, but some<lb break="yes"/>weeks after, another missionary, one of the pre-<lb break="no"/>decessors of this ecclesiastic, whom we found<lb break="yes"/>settled at San Fernando, as president of the<lb break="yes" />missions, related to us an event which I recorded<lb break="yes"/>in my journal, and which excited in our minds<lb break="yes"/>the most painful feelings. If, in these solitary<lb break="yes"/>scenes, man scarcely leaves behind him any<lb break="yes"/>trace of his existence, it is doubly humiliating<lb break="yes"/>for a European to see perpetuated by the name<lb break="yes"/>of a rock, by one of those imperishable monu-<lb break="no" />ments of nature, the remembrance of the moral<lb break="yes"/>degradation of our species, and the contrast be-<lb break="no"/>tween the virtues of a savage and the barbarism<lb break="yes"/>of civilised man.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>In the year 1797, the missionary of San Fer-<lb break="no"/>nando had led his
                    Indians to the banks of the<lb break="yes"/>Rio <choice><sic>Guaviave</sic><corr
                            type="editorial">Guaviare</corr></choice>, on one of those hostile
                        incursions<lb break="yes"/>which are prohibited alike by religion and the<lb
                        break="yes"/>Spanish laws. They found in an Indian hut, a<lb break="yes"
                    />Guahibi mother with three children, two of<lb break="yes"/>whom were still
                    infants. They were occupied<lb break="yes"/>in preparing the flour of Cassava:
                        resistance<lb break="yes"/>was impossible; the father was gone to fish,<lb
                        break="yes"/>and the mother tried in vain to flee with her<lb break="yes"
                    />children. Scarcely had she reached the savan-<lb break="no"/>nah, when she was
                    seized by the Indians of the<lb break="yes"/>mission, who go to hunt men, like
                    the whites<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="125" facs="#f0002"/>
                    <cb/> and the negroes in Africa. The mother and her<lb break="yes"/>children
                    were bound, and dragged to the bank<lb break="yes"/>of the river; the monk,
                    seated in his boat,<lb break="yes"/>waited the issue of an expedition, of which
                        he<lb break="yes"/>partook <choice><sic>of</sic><corr type="editorial"
                            >not</corr></choice> the danger. Had the mother made<lb break="yes"/>too
                    violent a resistance, the Indians would have<lb break="yes"/>killed her; for
                    every thing is permitted when<lb break="yes"/>they go to the conquest of souls,
                    and it is chil-<lb break="no"/>dren in particular they seek to capture, in
                        order<lb break="yes"/>to treat them in the mission as poitos, or slaves<lb
                        break="yes"/>of the Christians. The prisoners were carried<lb break="yes"
                    />to San Fernando, in the hope that the mother<lb break="yes"/>would be unable
                    to find her way back to her<lb break="yes"/>home by land. Far from those
                    children who<lb break="yes"/>had accompanied their father on the day in<lb
                        break="yes"/>which she had been carried off, this unhappy<lb break="yes"
                    />woman showed signs of the deepest despair.<lb break="yes"/>She attempted to
                    take back to her family the<lb break="yes"/>children who had been snatched away
                    by the<lb break="yes"/>missionary, and fled with them repeatedly from<lb
                        break="yes"/>the village of San Fernando, but the Indians<lb break="yes"
                    />never failed to seize her anew; and the mis-<lb break="no"/>sionary, after
                    having caused her to be merci-<lb break="no"/>lessly beaten, took the cruel
                    resolution of<lb break="yes"/>separating the mother from the two children<lb
                        break="yes"/>who had been carried off with her. She was<lb break="yes"
                    />conveyed alone towards the mission of the<lb break="yes"
                            /><choice><sic>Negroe</sic><corr type="editorial">Rio
                        Negro</corr></choice>, going up to the Atabapo; slightly<lb break="yes"
                    />bound, she was seated at the bow of the boat,<lb break="yes"/>ignorant of the
                    fate that awaited her; but she<lb break="yes"/>judged by the direction of the
                    sun, that she was<lb break="yes"/>removed farther and farther from her hut,
                        and<lb break="yes"/>her native country. She succeeded in breaking<lb
                        break="yes"/>her bonds, threw herself into the water, and<lb break="yes"
                    />swam to the left bank of the Atabapo; the cur-<lb break="no"/>rent carried her
                    to a shelf of rock, which<lb break="yes"/>bears her name to this day. She
                    landed, and<lb break="yes"/>took shelter in the woods, but the president<lb
                        break="yes"/>of the missions ordered the Indians to row<lb break="yes"/>to
                    shore, and follow the traces of the Guahibi.<lb break="yes"/>In the evening she
                    was brought back, stretched<lb break="yes"/>upon the rock (la Piedra de la
                    Madre), a cruel<lb break="yes"/>punishment was inflicted on her with those<lb
                        break="yes"/>straps of <choice><sic>menatee</sic><corr type="editorial"

                    />in that country, and with which the alcades are<lb break="yes"/>always
                    furnished. This unhappy woman, her<lb break="yes"/>hands tied back with strong
                    stalks of mavacure,<lb break="yes"/>was then dragged to the mission of
                    Javita.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>She was then thrown into one of the caravan-<lb break="no"/>seras, that are
                    called Casa <choice><sic>de Roy</sic><corr type="editorial">del
                        Rey</corr></choice>. It was the<lb break="yes"/>rainy season, and the night
                    was profoundly<lb break="yes"/>dark. Forests, till then believed to be
                        impene-<lb break="no"/>trable, separated the mission of Javita from<lb
                        break="yes"/>that of San Fernando, which was twenty-four<lb break="yes"
                    />leagues distant in a straight line. No other<lb break="yes"/>part is known
                    than that of the rivers; no man<lb break="yes"/>ever attempted to go by land
                    from one village<lb break="yes"/>to another, were they only a few leagues
                        apart;<lb break="yes"/>but such difficulties do not stop a mother who is<lb
                        break="yes"/>separated from her children. Her children are<lb break="yes"
                    />at San Fernando de <choice><sic>Antababe</sic><corr type="editorial"
                            >Atababo</corr></choice>; she must find<lb break="yes"/>
                    <cb/> them again&#x2014;she must execute her project of<lb break="yes"

                        >Guaviare</corr></choice>. The Guahibi was<lb break="yes"/>carelessly
                    guarded in the caravansera. Her<lb break="yes"/>arms being wounded, the Indians
                    of Javita<lb break="yes"/>had loosened her bonds, unknown to the mis-<lb
                        break="no"/>sionary and the alcades: she succeeded by the<lb break="yes"
                    />help of her teeth in breaking them entirely;<lb break="yes"/>disappeared
                    during the night, and at the fourth<lb break="yes"/>rising sun, was seen at the
                    mission of San Fer-<lb break="no"/>nando, hovering around the hut where her
                        chil-<lb break="no"/>dren were confined. &#x201C;What that woman per-<lb
                        break="no"/>formed,&#x201D; added the missionary who gave us this<lb
                        break="yes"/>sad narrative, &#x201C;the most robust Indian would<lb
                        break="yes"/>not have ventured to undertake. She traversed<lb break="yes"
                    />the woods at a season when the sky is con-<lb break="no"/>stantly covered with
                    clouds, and the sun, during<lb break="yes"/>whole days, appears but for a few
                    minutes. Did<lb break="yes"/>the course of the waters direct her way? The in-<lb
                        break="no"/>undation of the river forced her to go far from<lb break="yes"
