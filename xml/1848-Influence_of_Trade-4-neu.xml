                    subsequently to the Baltic and the country of the Esthonians, owes its first
                    origin to<lb/>the boldness and perseverance of Ph&#x0153;nician coast
                    navigators. In its subsequent exten-<lb/>sion, it offers, in the point of view
                    of which we are treating, a remarkable instance of<lb/>the influence which may
                    be exerted by a predilection for even a single foreign production<lb/>in opening
                    an inland trade between nations, and in making known large tracts of
                    country.<lb/>In the same way that the Phoc&#x00E6;an Massilians brought the
                    British tin across France to the<lb/>Rhone, the amber was conveyed from people
                    to people through Germany, and by the<lb/>Celts on either declivity of the Alps
                    to the Padus, and through Pannonia to the Borys-<lb/>thenes. It was this inland
                    traffic which first brought the coasts of the Northern Ocean<lb/>into connection
                    with the Euxine and the Adriatic.&#x2014;<hi rendition="#i">Cosmos.</hi></p></div><lb/></body><back></back>
