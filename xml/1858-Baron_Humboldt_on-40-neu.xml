                                                  Julius Froebel, a German author of some

                                                  engaged. May you continue to brand that
                                                  shame-<lb/>ful leaning to slavery, and that
                                                  imposture about introducing<lb/>negroes who are
                                                  said to become free, and which is a means
                                                  to<lb/>encourage those negro hunts in the interior

                                                  not<lb/>been prohibited in Madrid, yet in the
                                                  United States, which<lb/>you call &#x2018;the

                                                  at night, being much worried<lb/>by an

                                                  towards which I have striven ever since
                                                  my<lb/>early youth, and with ever equal warmth, so
