                <p>
                    <hi rendition="#in">O</hi>N the subject of earthquakes, the field of observation<lb break="yes"/>is both varied and extensive; but the scientific des-<lb break="no"/>cription of one is worth the detail of fifty, where the<lb break="yes"/>marvellous hath supplied knowledge, and fear has shrunk<lb break="yes"/>from the investigation of the causes that produce these<lb break="yes"/>phenomena.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>There are few events in the physical world which are<lb break="yes"/>calculated to excite so deep and permanent an interest<lb break="yes"/>as the earthquake which destroyed the town of Caraccas<lb break="yes"/>in 1812, and by which more than 20,000 persons pe-<lb break="no"/>rished, almost at the same instant, in the province of<lb break="yes"/>Venezuela, in South America.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>The 26th of March was a remarkably hot day. The<lb break="yes"/>air was calm, and the sky unclouded. It was Holy<lb break="yes"/>Thursday, and a great part of the population was as-<lb break="no"/>sembled in the churches. Nothing seemed to presage the<lb break="yes"/>calamities of the day. At seven minutes after four in<lb break="yes"/>the afternoon the first shock was felt; it was sufficiently<lb break="yes"/>powerful to make the bells of the churches toll; it lasted<lb break="yes"/>five or six seconds, during which time the ground was in<lb break="yes"/>a continual undulating movement, and seemed to heave<lb break="yes"/>up like a boiling liquid. The danger was thought to be<lb break="yes"/>past, when a tremendous subterraneous noise was heard,<lb break="yes"/>resembling the rolling of thunder, but louder, and of<lb break="yes"/>longer continuance than that heard within the tropics in<lb break="yes"/>in time of storms. This noise preceded a perpendicular<lb break="yes"/>motion of three or four seconds, followed by an undula-<lb break="no"/>tory movement somewhat longer. The shocks were in<lb break="yes" />opposite directions, from north to south, and from east<lb break="yes"/>to west. Nothing could resist the movement from be-<lb break="no"/>neath upward, and undulations crossing each other.<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="266" facs="#f0002"/>The town of Caraccas was entirely overthrown. Be-<lb break="no"/>tween nine and ten thousand of the inhabitants were<lb break="yes"/>buried under the ruins of the houses and churches. The<lb break="yes"/>procession had not yet set out; but the crowd was so<lb break="yes"/>great in the churches, that nearly three or four thou-<lb break="no"/>sand persons were crushed by the fall of their vaulted<lb break="yes"/>roofs. The explosion was stronger towards the north,<lb break="yes"/>in that part of the town situated nearest the mountain<lb break="yes"/>of Avila, and the Silla. The churches of la Trinidad<lb break="yes"/>and Alta Gracia, which were more than 150 feet high,<lb break="yes"/>and the naves of which were supported by pillars of<lb break="yes"/>twelve or fifteen feet diameter, left a mass of ruins<lb break="yes"/>scarcely exceeding five or six feet in elevation. The<lb break="yes"/>sinking of the ruins has been so considerable, that there<lb break="yes"/>now scarcely remain any vestiges of pillars or columns.<lb break="yes"/>The barracks, called <hi rendition="#i">El Quartel de San Carlos,</hi> situate<lb break="yes"/>farther north of the church of the Trinity, on the road<lb break="yes"/>from the custom-house de la Pastora, almost entirely<lb break="yes"/>disappeared. A regiment of troops of the line, that was<lb break="yes"/>assembled under arms, ready to join the procession, was,<lb break="yes"/>with the exception of a few men, buried under the ruins<lb break="yes"/>of this great edifice. Nine tenths of the fine town of<lb break="yes"/>Caraccas were entirely destroyed. The walls of the<lb break="yes"/>houses that were not thrown down, as those of the street<lb break="yes"/>San Juan, near the Capuchin Hospital, were cracked in<lb break="yes"/>such a manner, that it was impossible to run the risk of<lb break="yes"/>inhabiting them.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Estimating at nine or ten thousand the number of the<lb break="yes"/>dead in the city of Caraccas, we do not include those<lb break="yes"/>unhappy persons, who, dangerously wounded, perished<lb break="yes"/>several months after, for want of food and proper atten-<lb break="no"/>tion. The night of Holy Thursday presented the most<lb break="yes"/>distressing scene of desolation and sorrow. That thick<lb break="yes"/>cloud of dust, which, rising above the ruins, darkened<lb break="yes"/>the sky like a fog, had settled on the ground. No shock<lb break="yes"/>was felt, and never was a night more calm or more serene.<lb break="yes"/>The moon, nearly full, illumined the rounded domes<lb break="yes"/>of the Silla, and the aspect of the sky formed a perfect<lb break="yes"/>contrast to that of the earth, covered with the dead, and<lb break="yes"/>heaped with ruins. Mothers were seen bearing in<lb break="yes"/>their arms their children, whom they hoped to recall<lb break="yes"/>to life. Desolate families wandered through the city,<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="267" facs="#f0003"/>seeking a brother, a husband, a friend, of whose fate<lb break="yes"/>they were ignorant, and whom they believed to be<lb break="yes"/>lost in the crowd. The people pressed along the streets,<lb break="yes"/>which could no more be recognised but by long lines of<lb break="yes"/>ruins.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>All the calamities experienced in the great catas-<lb break="no"/>trophes of Lisbon, Messina, Lima, and Riobamba,<lb break="yes"/>were renewed on the fatal day of the 26th of March,<lb break="yes"/>1812. The wounded, buried under the ruins, implor-<lb break="no"/>ed by their cries the help of the passers by, and near-<lb break="no"/>ly 2000 were dug out. Implements for digging, and<lb break="yes"/>clearing away the ruins were entirely wanting; and<lb break="yes"/>the people were obliged to use their bare hands to dis-<lb break="no"/>inter the living. The wounded, as well as the sick who<lb break="yes"/>had escaped from the <choice><sic>hospitals.</sic><corr type="editorial">hospitals,</corr></choice> were laid on the banks<lb break="yes"/>of the small river Guayra. They found no shelter but<lb break="yes"/>the foliage of the trees. Beds, linen to dress the<lb break="yes"/>wounds, instruments of surgery, medicines, and ob-<lb break="no"/>jects of the most urgent necessity, were buried under<lb break="yes"/>the ruins. Every thing, even food, was wanting during<lb break="yes"/>the first days. Water became alike scarce in the inte-<lb break="no"/>rior of the city. The commotion had rent the pipes of<lb break="yes"/>the fountains; the falling of the earth had choked up<lb break="yes"/>the springs that supplied them; and it became neces-<lb break="no"/>sary, in order to have water, to go down to the river<lb break="yes"/>Guayra, which was considerably swelled; and then ves-<lb break="no"/>sels to convey the water were wanting.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>There remained a duty to be fulfilled towards the<lb break="yes"/>dead, enjoined at once by piety and the dread of infec-<lb break="no"/>tion. It being impossible to inter so many thousand<lb break="yes"/>corpses, half buried under the ruins, commissaries<lb break="yes"/>were appointed to burn the bodies: and for this pur-<lb break="no"/>pose, funeral piles were erected between the heaps of<lb break="yes"/>ruins. This ceremony lasted several days. Amid so<lb break="yes"/>many public calamities, the people devoted themselves<lb break="yes"/>to those religious duties which they thought were the<lb break="yes"/>most fitted to appease the wrath of heaven. Some, as-<lb break="no"/>sembling in procession, sung funeral hymns: others,<lb break="yes"/>in a state of distraction, confessed themselves aloud in<lb break="yes"/>the streets. In this town was now repeated what had<lb break="yes"/>been remarked in the province of Quito, after the tre-<lb break="no"/>mendous earthquake of 1797; a number of marriages<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="268" facs="#f0004"/>were contracted between persons who had neglected for<lb break="yes"/>many years to sanction their union by the sacerdotal<lb break="yes"/>benediction. Children found parents by whom they had<lb break="yes"/>never till then been acknowledged; restitutions were<lb break="yes"/>promised by persons, who had never been accused of<lb break="yes"/>fraud; and families, who had long been enemies, were<lb break="yes"/>drawn together by the tie of common calamity. If<lb break="yes" />this feeling seemed to calm the passions of some, and<lb break="yes"/>open the heart to pity, it had a contrary effect on others,<lb break="yes"/>rendering them more rigid and inhuman.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Shocks as violent as those which, in the space of one<lb break="yes"/>minute<note place="foot" n="*">The duration of the earthquake, that is to say, the<lb break="yes"/>whole of the movements of undulation and rising which<lb break="yes"/>occasioned the horrible catastrophe of the 26th of March,<lb break="yes"/>1812, was estimated by some at fifty seconds, by others<lb break="yes"/>at one minute and twelve seconds.</note>, overthrew the city of Caraccas, could not be<lb break="yes"/>confined to a small portion of the continent. Their<lb break="yes"/>fatal effects extended as far as the provinces of Vene-<lb break="no"/>zuela, Verinas, and Maracaybo, along the coast; and<lb break="yes"/>still more to the inland mountains. La Guayra, May-<lb break="no"/>quetia, Antimano, Baruta, La Vega, San Felipe, and<lb break="yes"/>Merida, were almost entirely destroyed. The number<lb break="yes"/>of the dead exceeded four or five thousand at La Guayra<lb break="yes"/>and the town of San Felipe, near the copper-mines of<lb break="yes"/>Aroa. It appears, that it was on a line running east<lb break="yes"/>north-east, and west south-west, from La Guayra and<lb break="yes"/>and Carraccas to the lofty mountains of Niquitao and<lb break="yes"/>Merida, that the violence of the earthquake was princi-<lb break="no"/>pally directed. It was felt in the kingdom of New<lb break="yes" />Granada from the branches of the high Sierra de Santa<lb break="yes"/>Martha as far as Santa Fe de Bogota and Honda, on<lb break="yes"/>the banks of Magdelena, 180 leagues from Carraccas.<lb break="yes"/>It was every where more violent in the Cordilleras of<lb break="yes"/>gneiss and mica-slate, or immediately at their foot,<lb break="yes"/>than in the plains: and this difference was particularly<lb break="yes"/>striking in the savannahs of Varinas and Casanara. In<lb break="yes"/>the valleys of Aragua, situate between Carraccas and<lb break="yes"/>the town of San Felipe, the commotions were very<lb break="yes"/>weak: and <choice><sic>La Victori, a</sic><corr type="editorial">La Victoria,</corr></choice> Maracay, and Valentia, scarce-<lb break="no"/>
                    <pb n="269" facs="#f0005"/>ly suffered at all, notwithstanding their proximity to<lb break="yes"/>the capital. At Valecillo, a few leagues from Valencia,<lb break="yes"/>the earth, opening, threw out such an immense quan-<lb break="no"/>tity of water, that it formed a new torrent. The<lb break="yes"/>same phenomenon took place near Porto-Cabello. On<lb break="yes"/>the other hand, the lake Maracaybo diminished sensibly.<lb break="yes"/>At Coro no commotion was felt, though the town is si-<lb break="no"/>tuated upon the coast, between other towns which<lb break="yes" />suffered from the earthquake.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>Fifteen or eighteen hours after the great catastrophe, the<lb break="yes"/>ground remained tranquil. The night, as we have already<lb break="yes"/>observed, was fine and calm; and the commotions did<lb break="yes"/>not recommence till after the 27th. They then were at-<lb break="no"/>tended with a very loud and long continued subterra-<lb break="no"/>nean noise. The inhabitants of Caraccas wandered into<lb break="yes"/>the country; but the villages and farms having suffered<lb break="yes"/>as much as the town, they could find no shelter till they<lb break="yes"/>were beyond the mountains of Los Teques, in the val-<lb break="no"/>leys of Aragua, and in the Llanos or savannahs. No<lb break="yes"/>less than fifteen oscillations were often felt in one day.<lb break="yes"/>On the fifth of April there were almost as violent an<lb break="yes"/>earthquake, as that which overthrew the capital. Dur-<lb break="no"/>ing several hours, the ground was in a state <choice>

                        <corr type="editorial">of</corr>
                    </choice> perpetual<lb break="yes"/>undulation. Large masses of earth fell in the moun-<lb break="no"/>tains; and enormous rocks were detached from the Silla<lb break="yes"/>of Caraccas. It was even asserted and believed that the<lb break="yes"/>two domes of the Silla sunk fifty or sixty toises; but<lb break="yes"/>this assertion is founded on no measurement whatever.<choice>

                <p>On the 7th day of June, 1692, the town of Port Royal<lb break="yes"/>in Jamaica, was in two minutes totally destroyed by an<lb break="yes"/>earthquake: Various instances of the destructive effects<lb break="yes"/>of this terrible phenomenon might be adduced, but the<lb break="yes"/>preceding have exceeded the limits assigned for this por-<lb break="no"/>tion of our Museum.</p>
