                    us all well ac-<lb/>quainted with what is called the &#x201C;bread tree,&#x201D;
                    as well as<lb/>another kind, known under the name of the &#x201C;butter-<lb
                        break="hyph-yes"/>tree.&#x201D; But it remained for the indefatigable M.
                    Hum-<lb/>boldt to discover, in the wilds of South America, a tree<lb/>which
                    produces ready-made shirts. &#x201C;We saw on the<lb/>slope of the Cerra <choice>
                        <sic>Dnida</sic>
                        <corr type="editorial">Duida</corr>
                    </choice>,&#x201D; says M. Humboldt, &#x201C;shirt-<lb break="hyph-yes"/>trees,
                    fifty feet high. The Indians cut off cylindrical<lb/>pieces two feet in
                    diameter, from which they peel the red<lb/>and fibrous bark, without making any
                    longitudinal inci-<lb/>sion. This bark affords them a sort of garment which
                    re-<lb/>sembles sacks of a very coarse texture, and without a<lb/>seam. The
                    upper opening serves for the head, and two<lb/>lateral holes are cut to admit
                    the arms. The natives wear<lb/>these shirts of <choice>
                        <sic>mirima</sic>
                        <corr type="editorial">marima</corr>
                    </choice> in the rainy season; they have the<lb/>form of the ponchos and ruanos
                    of cotton, which are so<lb/>common in New Granada, at Quito, and in Peru. As
                    in<lb/>these climates the riches and beneficence of nature are<lb/>regarded as
                    the primary causes of the indolence of the<lb/>inhabitants, the missionaries do
                    not fail to say, in show-<lb/>ing the shirts of marima, &#x2018;In the forests
                    of the Oronoko<lb/>garments are found ready made on the trees.&#x2019;
                    We<lb/>may add to this tale of the shirts the pointed caps which<lb/>the spathes
                    of certain palm-trees furnish, and which re-<lb/>semble coarse
                    net-work.&#x201D;</p></div><lb/></body><back></back>
