                <p>&#x2014;The following,<lb/>from a letter addressed lately by Alexander
                    Von<lb/>Humboldt to Julius Froebel, a German author of some<lb/>distinction, and
                    formerly a member of the Parliament<lb/>at Frankfort, may not be without
                    interest to some of our<lb/>readers, partly from the question of slavery it
                    alludes<lb/>to, and partly from the noble image it exhibits of<lb/>the undying
                    earnestness of purpose in that &#x201C;old
                    man<lb/>eloquent:&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;I should like to live long
                    enough<lb/>yet to see your book <hi rendition="#i">On the Political State
                        of<lb/>America,</hi> with which you are engaged. May you<lb/>continue to
                    brand that shameful leaning to slavery,<lb/>and that imposture about introducing
                    negroes who<lb/>are said to become free, and which is a means to<lb/>encourage
                    those negro hunts in the interior of Africa.<lb/>What horrors one is obliged to
                    witness, if one has the<lb/>misfortune of living from <choice><sic>1707</sic><corr type="editorial">1789</corr></choice> to 1858. My
                    book<lb/>against slavery has not been prohibited in Madrid, yet<lb/>in the
                    United States, which you call &#x2018;the republic of<lb/>gentlemen,&#x2019; it
                    could only become saleable by the omis-<lb/>sion of all that concerns the
                    sufferings of coloured peo-<lb/>ple who, according to my political views, are
                    fellow-men<lb/>entitled to enjoy any amount of freedom. I lead an
                    in-<lb/>dustrious life, chiefly at night, being much worried by<lb/>an
                    ever-increasing and mostly uninteresting correspon-<lb/>dence. I exist
                    joylessly, in my 89th year, since of so<lb/>many things towards which I have
                    striven ever since my<lb/>early youth, and with ever equal warmth, so very
                    little<lb/>has been fulfilled.&#x201D;</p>
