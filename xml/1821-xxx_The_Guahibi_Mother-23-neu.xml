                <p>Near the confluence of the Atabapo and the Rio <choice><sic>Jerni</sic><corr
                            type="editorial">Temi</corr></choice>,<lb break="yes"/>there is a
                    granite hummock that rises on the western<lb break="yes"/>bank, near the mouth
                    of the <choice><sic>Guaosiau</sic><corr type="editorial"
                        >Guasacavi</corr></choice>; it is called the<lb break="yes"/>Rock of the
                    Guahiba Woman, or the Rock of the Mother,<lb break="yes"/>(<hi rendition="#i"
                        >Piedra de la Madre</hi>,) from the trait of maternal affec-<lb break="no"
                    />tion attached to it.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>&#x201C;If,&#x201D; says the enterprising Humboldt, &#x201C;in these soli-<lb break="no"/>tary scenes man scarcely leaves behind him any traces<lb break="yes"/>of his existence, it is doubly humiliating for a European<lb break="yes"/>to see perpetuated by the name of a rock, by one of those<lb break="yes"/>imperishable monuments of nature, the remembrance of<lb break="yes"/>the moral degradation of our species, and the contrast<lb break="yes"/>between the virtue of a savage and the barbarism of<lb break="yes"/>civilized man.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>&#x201C;In 1797, the missionary of San Fernando had led<lb break="yes"/>his
                    Indians to the mouth of the Rio Guaviare, on one of<lb break="yes"/>those
                    hostile incursions which are prohibited alike by<lb break="yes"/>religion and
                    the Spanish laws. They found, in an <choice><sic>Italian</sic><corr
                            type="editorial">Indian</corr></choice><lb break="yes"/>hut, a Guahiba
                    mother with three children, two of whom<lb break="yes"/>were still infants. They
                    were occupied in preparing the<lb break="yes"/>flour of Cassava. Resistance was
                    impossible; the<lb break="yes"/>father was gone to fish, and the mother tried in
                    vain to<lb break="yes"/>flee with her children. Scarcely had she reached the<lb
                        break="yes"/>savanna, when she was seized by the Indians of the<lb
                        break="yes"/>mission, who go to <hi rendition="#i">hunt men</hi>, like the
                    whites and the<lb break="yes"/>negroes in Africa. The mother and her children
                        were<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="31" facs="#f0002"/> found, and dragged to the bank of the river. The
                        monk,<lb break="yes"/>seated in his boat, waited the issue of an expedition
                        of<lb break="yes"/>which he partook not the danger. Had the mother made<lb
                        break="yes"/>too violent a resistance, the Indians would have killed<lb
                        break="yes"/>her, for everything is permitted when they go to the<lb
                        break="yes"/>conquest of souls, (<hi rendition="#i">à la conquista
                        espiritual,</hi>) and it is<lb break="yes"/>children in particular they seek
                    to capture, in order to<lb break="yes"/>treat them, in the mission, as <hi
                        rendition="#i">poitos</hi>, or slaves of the<lb break="yes"/>Christians. The
                    prisoners were carried to San Fer-<lb break="no"/>nando, in the hope that the
                    mother would be unable to<lb break="yes"/>find her way back to her home by land.
                    Far from those<lb break="yes"/>children who had accompanied their father on the
                        day<lb break="yes"/>on which she had been carried off, this unhappy woman<lb
                        break="yes"/>showed signs of the deepest despair. She attempted to<lb
                        break="yes"/>take back to her family the children who had been<lb
                        break="yes"/>snatched away by the missionary, and fled with them<lb
                        break="yes"/>repeatedly from the village of San Fernando; but the<lb
                        break="yes"/>Indians never failed to seize her anew; and the mission-<lb
                        break="no"/>ary, after having caused her to be mercilessly beaten,<lb
                        break="yes"/>took the cruel resolution of separating the mother from<lb
                        break="yes"/>the two children who had been carried off with her.<lb
                        break="yes"/>She was conveyed alone toward the missions of the Rio<lb
                        break="yes"/>Negro, going up to the Atabapo. Slightly bound, she<lb
                        break="yes"/>was seated at the bow of the boat, ignorant of the fate<lb
                        break="yes"/>that awaited her; but she judged, by the direction of the<lb
                        break="yes"/>sun, that she was removed further and further from her<lb
                        break="yes"/>hut and her native country. She succeeded in breaking<lb
                        break="yes"/>her bonds, threw herself into the water, and swam to the<lb
                        break="yes"/>left bank of the Atabapo. The current carried her to a<lb
                        break="yes"/>shelf of rock, which bears her name to this day. She<lb
                        break="yes"/>landed; and took shelter in the woods; but the president<lb
                        break="yes"/>of the missions ordered the Indians to row to the shore<lb
                        break="yes"/>and follow the traces of the Guahiba. In the evening<lb
                        break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="32" facs="#f0003"/> she was brought back. Stretched upon the rock, <hi
                        rendition="#i">la<lb break="yes"/>Piedra de la Madre,</hi> a cruel
                    punishment was inflicted on<lb break="yes"/>her with those straps of manatee
                    leather which serve<lb break="yes"/>for whips in that country, and with which
                    the alcades<lb break="yes"/>are always furnished. This unhappy woman, her
                        hands<lb break="yes"/>tied behind her back with strong stalks of <hi
                        rendition="#i">mavacure</hi>, was<lb break="yes"/>then dragged to the
                    mission of Javita.</p>
                <lb break="yes"/>
                <p>&#x201C;She was there thrown into one of the caravanseras,<lb break="yes"/>that
                    are called Casa del Rey. It was the rainy season,<lb break="yes"/>and the night
                    was profoundly dark. Forests, till then<lb break="yes"/>believed to be
                    impenetrable, separated the mission of<lb break="yes"/>Javita from that of San
                    Fernando, which was twenty-five<lb break="yes"/>leagues distant, in a straight
                    line. No other part is<lb break="yes"/>known than that of the rivers; no man
                    ever attempted<lb break="yes"/>to go by land from one village to another, were
                        they<lb break="yes"/>only a few leagues apart. But such difficulties do
                        not<lb break="yes"/>stop a mother who is separated from her children. Her<lb
                        break="yes"/>children are at San Fernando de Atabapo; she must find<lb
                        break="yes"/>them again; she must execute her project of delivering<lb
                        break="yes"/>them from the hands of the Christians, of bringing them<lb
                        break="yes"/>back to their father on the banks of the Guaviare. The<lb
                        break="yes"/>Guahiba was carelessly guarded in the caravansera.<lb
                        break="yes"/>Her arms being wounded, the Indians of Javita had<lb
                        break="yes"/>loosened her bonds, unknown to the missionary and the<lb
                        break="yes"/>alcades. She succeeded, by the help of her teeth, in<lb
                        break="yes"/>breaking them entirely; disappeared during the night;<lb
                        break="yes"/>and at the fourth rising sun was seen at the mission<lb
                        break="yes"/>of San Fernando, hovering around the hut where<lb break="yes"
                    />her children were confined. &#x2018;What the woman per-<lb break="no"
                    />formed,&#x2019; added the missionary, who gave us this sad<lb break="yes"
                    />narrative, &#x2018;the most robust Indian would not have ven-<lb break="no"

                    the sky is constantly covered with clouds, and<lb break="yes"/>
                    <pb n="33" facs="#f0004"/> the sun, during whole days, appears but for a few<lb
                        break="yes"/>minutes. Did the course of the waters direct her way?<lb
                        break="yes"/>The inundations of the rivers forced her to go far from<lb
                        break="yes"/>the banks of the main stream, through the midst of<lb
                        break="yes"/>woods, where the movement of the water is almost im-<lb
                        break="no"/>perceptible. How often must she have been stopped by<lb
                        break="yes"/>the thorny lianas, that form a network around the trunks<lb

                        break="yes"/>the rivulets that run into the Atabapo?&#x2019; This
                        unfortu-<lb break="no"/>nate woman was asked how she had sustained
                        herself<lb break="yes"/>during the four days? She said, &#x2018;that,
                    exhausted with<lb break="yes"/>fatigue, she could find no other nourishment than
                        those<lb break="yes"/>great black ants, called <hi rendition="#i"
                        >vachacos</hi>, which climb the trees<lb break="yes"/>in long bands, to
                    suspend on them their resinous nests.&#x2019;<lb break="yes"/>We pressed the
                    missionary to tell us whether the Gua-<lb break="no"/>hiba had peacefully
                    enjoyed the happiness of remaining<lb break="yes"/>with her children; and if any
                    repentance had followed<lb break="yes"/>this excess of cruelty. He would not
                    satisfy our curi-<lb break="no"/>osity; but, at our return from the Rio Negro,
                    we learnt<lb break="yes"/>that the Indian mother was not allowed time to cure
                        her<lb break="yes"/>wounds; but was again separated from her children,
                        and<lb break="yes"/>sent to one of the missions of the Upper Oroonoko.<lb
                        break="yes"/>There she died, refusing all kind of nourishment, as the<lb
