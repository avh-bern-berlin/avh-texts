    <p>&#x201C;That I should be destined&#x2014;I, an old man of eighty-<lb break="maybe"
                    />three&#x2014;to announce to you, dear Sir Roderick, the<lb/>saddest news that
                    I could have to convey:&#x2014;to you for<lb/>whom M. De Buch professed a
                    friendship so tender&#x2014;<lb/>and to the many admirers of his genius, his
                    vast la-<lb/>bours, and his noble character! Leopold De Buch<lb/>was taken from
                    us this morning by typhoid fever&#x2014;so<lb/>violent in its attack that two
                    days only of danger<lb/>warned us. He was at my house so lately as the
                    26th<lb/>[ult.], despite the snow and the distance between
                    us&#x2014;<lb/>talking geology with the most lively interest. That<lb/>evening
                    he went into society; and on Sunday and Mon-<lb/>day (the 27th and 28th) he
                    complained of a feverish<lb/>attack, which he believed to be caused by a large
                    chil-<lb/>blain swelling from which he had suffered for years.<lb/>The
                    inflammation required the application of leeches&#x2014;<lb/>but the pain and
                    the fever increased. He was speech-<lb/>less for thirty-eight hours. ... He died
                    sur-<lb/>rounded by his friends&#x2014;most of whom knew nothing of<lb/>his
                    danger till Wednesday evening, the 2d of March.<lb/>He and I were united by a
                    friendship of sixty-three<lb/>years&#x2014;a friendship which never knew
                    interruption. I<lb/>found him in 1791, in Werner&#x2019;s house in
                    Freiburg,<lb/>when I entered the School of Mines. We were toge-<lb/>ther in
                    Italy, in Switzerland, in France&#x2014;four months<lb/>in Saltzburg. M. De Buch
                    was not only one of the<lb/>great illustrations of his age&#x2014;he was a man
                    of noble<lb/>soul. His mind left a track of light wherever it<lb/>passed. Always
                    in contact with Nature herself&#x2014;he<lb/>could boast of having extended the
                    limits of geological<lb/>science. I grieve for him profoundly&#x2014;without him
                    I<lb/>feel desolate. I consulted him as a master; and his<lb/>affection (like
                    that of Gay Lussac and that of Arago,<lb/>who were also his friends) sustained
                    me in my labours.<lb/>He was four years my junior&#x2014;and nothing
                    forewarned<lb/>me of this misfortune. It is not at the distance of a<lb/>few
                    hours only from such a loss, that I can say more<lb/>respecting it. Pity
                    me&#x2014;and accept the homage of my<lb/>profound respect and affectionate
                        devotion.</p><lb/><closer><salute><hi rendition="#et">&#x201C;<hi rendition="#k">Al. Humboldt.</hi></hi></salute></closer><lb/>
